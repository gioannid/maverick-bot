It hides information by playing a proper balance of randomized mixed strategy over all types of hands. However, in doing so, it will not attempt to exploit your weaknesses. It will merely attempt to defend against all possible methods of attack.

Tables.HuVexbot.Description     = Vexbot is a heads-up only player. It relies entirely on the model it builds of your playing style.

If it is raising you a lot, perhaps you are folding too much or playing too many weak hands. Vexbot can be a good tool for finding flaws in your own play. It can be an extremely vexing opponent to play, especially when it has a good model of you.  \n\nPlease note that it does take several hundred hands to learn how you play, after which it should increase in difficulty.
