In no-limit you rarely want to bet the minimum amount.  
You usually want to bet in increments of the pot (half the pot, 
pot, twice the pot). This forces drawing hands to either fold or
to call with incorrect odds.

<p>
Some exceptions:
<ul>
<li>You are making a small bet you think might steal a pot 
during a hand where everyone is showing weakness.</li>
<li>You are trying to entice someone to play back at you 
(re-raise you or move all in against you).</li>
</ul>
