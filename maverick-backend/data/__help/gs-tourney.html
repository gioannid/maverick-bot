<h1 align="center">Getting Started: Tournaments</h1>

To start a tournament select "Tournaments" from the 
<a href="gs-mainlobby.html">main lobby</a> to enter 
the tournament lobby.
<p>

There are three parts to setting up a tournament game: a) selection
of the tournament structure b) optionally editing that structure
and c) setting your field of opponents.

<h3>Game Structure Selection</h3>

On the left side of the screen is a tree view which contains
a number of tournament structures. These structures range from
single table tournaments to large multi-table tournaments&#8212;both
limit and no-limit. For the most part, they are drawn from 
well known public sources.
<p id="sidebar">
<b>Note:</b> If you don't finish a tournament in one sitting, it
is automatically saved. It will appear at the top of the tree
in an "Unfinished Tournaments" section. You can resume this tournament
or remove it.
</p>

<h3>Editing a Tournament Structure</h3>

Once you select a structure then the tournament information view
on the right is updated.  
<p>

The leftmost "Details" pane allows you to edit the important values
in the tournament structure such as starting bankroll.
<p>

The two rightmost panes show detailed information about the tournament
structure, which can be used to modify the tournament
parameters.
<p>

For more information on editing tournaments, see the <a href="tournlobby.html">
Tournament Lobby</a> section.

<h3>Setting the Opponents Line-up</h3>

Above the tabbed interface is a slider which selects the number of
opponents. Its minimum and maximum values are determined by the type
of tournament you selected on the left. Changing this slider will
fill up your tournament with random computer opponents.
<p>

If you would like more control over the field of opponents you can go
to the "Line-up" tab underneath the player count slider. For each
computer player in the tournament you can set the type of AI engine they use.
<p>

For more information on setting the line-up, see the <a href="tournlobby.html">
Tournament Lobby</a>.

<h3>Profile Selection</h3>

Underneath the list of tournaments on the left is the profile 
selection box.  You can select a profile to use or create a
new one. <a href="profiles.html">Profiles</a> are used by the computer opponents 
to learn how you play, and by the statistics system to track progress.

<h3>Launch the Game</h3>

Click the Load Table button to start playing!
<p>

There are some unique features to tournament game play.  See the <a href="tournplay.html">
Tournament Play</a> page for details.
