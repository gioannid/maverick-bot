<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>How to Play Texas Hold'em</h2>

A hand of Texas Hold'em begins with the <i>pre-flop</i>.  
Each player is dealt two <i>hole cards</i> face down, followed by 
the first round of betting which is started with two forced bets 
called the <i>small blind</i> and the <i>big blind</i>.

Three <i>community cards</i>, collectively called the <i>flop</i>,
are then dealt face up on the table, and the second round of 
betting occurs.  

On the <i>turn</i>, a fourth community card is dealt face up and 
another round of betting ensues.  

Finally, on the <i>river</i>, a fifth community card is dealt face 
up and the final round of betting occurs.  

The players still active in the game at that time reveal their 
two hole cards for the <i>showdown</i>.  

The best <a href="hands.html">five-card poker hand</a> 
formed from each player's two private hole cards and the 
five public community cards wins the pot.  If a tie occurs, 
the pot is split.
<p>
Texas Hold'em is typically played with 8 to 10 players.  Limit Texas Hold'em
uses a structured betting system, where the amount of each bet is strictly
controlled in each betting round (In Open or No-limit Texas Hold'em,
there are no restrictions on the size of bets; a player may wager any amount,
up to their entire stack, at any time.) There are two denominations of
bets, called a <i>small bet</i> and a <i>big bet</i>, which in this program
is $10 and $20 by default.  In the first two betting rounds, all bets and raises are
$10, while in the last two rounds, they are always $20.  In general, when it
is a player's turn to act, one of three betting options is available:
<i>fold</i>, <i>check/call</i>, or <i>bet/raise</i>. 
<p>
A <i>check</i> and a <i>call</i> are logically equivalent, in
that the betting level is not increased.  The term <i>check</i> is used
when the current betting level is zero, and <i>call</i> when there has
been a wager in the current betting round.  Similarly, a <i>bet</i> and
a <i>raise</i> are logically equivalent, but the term <i>bet</i> is
used for the first wager of a betting round.
<p>
There is a maximum of three raises allowed per betting round.
The betting option rotates clockwise until each player has matched the
current bet, or folded.  If there is only one player remaining (all
others having folded) that player is the winner and is awarded the pot
without having to reveal their cards.
