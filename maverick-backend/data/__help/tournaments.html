Tournament poker is one of the most popular ways to play poker these days.
With <i>Poker Academy</i> you can play and practice limit and no-limit
single-table and multi-table tournaments. 
The limit and no-limit designation refers to the type of betting structure in the tournament.
Unlike ring games, Tournaments have their own predefined structure which raises the blinds at 
certain intervals to ensure that the tournament will reach a conclusion.  The most common 
practise is to advance the level after a given amount of time has passed, or a certain number 
of hands have been played.  The single-table and multi-table
designation refers to how many tables are simultaneously dealing at any one
time of the tournament. Single-table tournaments only ever involve one table
and so all players are always seated together at the same table until they
bust out of the tournament. Multi-table tournaments add a new wrinkle to the 
tournament experience: as players bust out, the players remaining
are often moved from table to table in an effort to balance the number 
of players at each.
