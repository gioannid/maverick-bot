<h1 align="center">Table Menu Options</h1>


The options are accessible from the <i>Table</i> Menu, and are described below.  Many
of them are specific to playing ring games.

<ul>

<li><b>Shuffle Seats</b> (ring game only)<br>
Shuffle Seats randomizes the order of the opponents around a table.
This is a good way to change the configuration of a table without changing
the computer opponents.  It can be also used in conjunction with Hide Names in the
Options menu.  For example, you can 
start a table with known opponents, then hide their names and then shuffle 
the seats using this option.  You can then play at the table for 
a while and try to figure out which opponent is which based solely on 
how they play.  Once you have a guess of which player is which, you can 
flip the Hide Names option off and see how accurate your guesses were. 
<p>

<li><b>Save Table As...</b> (ring game only)<br>
If you have made changes to the configuration of the computer opponents
at the table this will allow you to save those changes as a new table
so you can choose this exact configuration again.
<p>

<li><b>Set Button</b> (ring games only)<br>
Set Button will set the button to the player specified in the submenu.
You can additionally use Freeze Button in the Options menu if you
wish to stop the button from moving.  This is good for practicing
various types of positional play.
<p>

<li><b>Set Bankroll</b> (ring games only)<br>
This brings up a dialog which allows you to set your bankroll.
<p>

<li><b>Set All Bankrolls</b> (ring games only)<br>
This brings up a dialog which allows you to set your
bankroll and any or all of the computer opponents bankrolls.
<p>

<li><b>Edit Opponents</b><br>
This is the main entry for creating new computer opponents, or
editing existing ones.  It will bring up a dialog box that lets
you flip between computer opponents and adjust their settings.
