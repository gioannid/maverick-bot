<h1 align="center">Vexbot</h1>

Vexbot is a heads-up only player. It relies entirely on the model
it builds of your playing style (so don't expect it to play very well
the first time you play it). It will attempt to maximally exploit
any and all weaknesses it finds in your playing style. 
<p>

Consequently, observing how it plays is like watching a mirror of your
own play. If it is raising you a lot, perhaps you are folding too much
or playing too many weak hands. Vexbot can be a good tool for finding 
flaws in your own play. It can be an extremely vexing opponent to play, 
especially when it has a good model of you.


<p id="sidebar">
Note: Vexbot may play badly at first. You must play a few hundred hands to 
teach it the basics of your style, before it can build a strong model of 
how you play. A person wishing to get the most out of vexbot should play a
match of a few thousand hands. If Vexbot is adapting properly, it should 
become increasingly difficult to beat.</p>

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

Vexbot can play two different pre-flop styles.
Vexbot can use its smarts in the pre-flop, just as it does in the post
flop. Unfortunately, using this method, Vexbot can take several seconds
to decide on an action. Most players will find this too slow for pre-flop
play. The alternative is a fast, rule-based pre-flop system, based on 
simulated expected values for each of the starting hands.

<p>
There is a slider which allows you to specify Vexbot's passive/aggressive
level. Passive play favors checking/calling and aggressive play favors
betting/raising.

<p>
A slider is also presented for <i>exploration</i> verses <i>exploitation</i>.
Exploitation will have Vexbot favoring to play in ways that have worked against 
you in the past. Exploration will have Vexbot more often deviate from exploiting 
what it already knows, so that it can learn and explore new playing styles against 
you.
