<h1 align="center">Take Your Game to the Next Level</h1>

The primary goal of Poker Academy is to help you become a better player.
Poker Academy Pro contains a comprehensive suite of powerful poker tools
no serious poker player should be without. You may be wondering how
you can best use these tools to improve and polish your game, and
most importantly, to increase your winnings. 

Learning even one new concept or plugging one small leak in your game 
will easily pay for the cost of this software <i>many times over</i>
once you put your new skills into action for real cash.

<h3>Practice, Practice, Practice</h3>
<div id="padded">
	Poker Academy Pro is the ultimate practice tool. There is no substitute for
	experience. With Poker Academy Pro you can play at high speed to gain
	experience fast. Unlike most humans in online play-money games, our 
	computer opponents always take the game seriously. Unlike real cash games,
	you can experiment with new styles and learn without losing your shirt.
	We offer a wide variety of different player styles to practice against.
	Your experience against a well rounded line-up of opponents will prove invaluable.

<h3>Drill on specific situations</h3>
<div id="padded">
	If you find yourself unsure of how best to play certain situations, you
	can use the <a href="dealeroptions.html">Dealer Options</a> to set up
	exact conditions and then drill on them until you are confident in your
	play. For example, learn the difference position makes by playing the same
	hand one hundred times each in early, middle, and late positions. Learn
	to play King-Queen offsuit under the gun by playing it hundreds of times
	in a row. The ability to isolate and train on specific scenarios is a
	powerful learning tool. You will feel extremely confident the next 
	time you find yourself in a well practiced position. 
</div>

 <h3>Learn to read hands</h3>
<div id="padded">
	Use the peek feature to see if your suspicions are correct. Play with
	all of the cards face up and study how each player plays their hand. 
	Review hand histories and <a href="handplayback.html">play back</a> 
	old sessions to see how well you played, and where you made mistakes.
	You can also use the 'instant replay' 
	feature to see if taking a different action would have made 
	you more money. For instance, you may have slow-played a set 
	on the flop, and now want to replay the same hand to see if 
	betting for value earlier would have built you a bigger pot.

 <h3>Try out new Concepts</h3>
<div id="padded">
	Reading poker books is an excellent way to learn and understand new
	poker concepts. As you are reading, put the concepts into practice
	by trying them out in Poker Academy. The combination of a well written
	reference book and the ability to demonstrate those concepts immediately
	will solidify your understanding.

<h3>Analyse Your Game</h3>	
<div id="padded">
Use the Player Statistics to find leaks in your game. Discover what hands
you play profitably, and which you lose money with. For instance, you 
can filter your hands by position and instantly see which starting hands
you are losing with in that position. You'll need to either stop playing
those hands in that position, or drill on them until you learn to play
them profitably. Use the Sharks & Fish list to see which players you are
winning and losing against. Use the bankroll graphs to spot trends in your
performance over time. Compare your statistics to other players to discover
how your style differs. 
</div>


<h3>Learn the odds</h3>	
<div id="padded">
It is vital to know the odds of making draws, the probability of your 
hand being the best, and the odds of winning if you jam with your pocket 
pair and your opponent calls you with two overcards. Poker Academy Pro
contains several tools to help develop a good intuition for poker math.
The Sidebar's <a href="sb-handeval.html">Hand Evaluator</a> gives real-time
stats on the strength of your hand. The more fully-featured 
<a href="evaluator.html">Hand Evaluator</a> window breaks down the probabilities
of your hand's strength, draws, and the opponent's likely holdings. The
<a href="calculator.html">Showdown Calculator</a> is an essential tool for
calculating the odds of any match up of hands. Using the 
showdown calculator will help you make the right judgement in tricky 
all-in situations.
