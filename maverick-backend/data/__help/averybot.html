<h3 align="center">By Brian Edwards &lt;brian@chrissyandbrian.com&gt;</h3>
Averybot plays an aggressive strategy for No-Limit tournaments.  It
attempts to build it's stack gradually as the blind levels progress,
while avoiding marginal situations that put a major portion of its
stack at risk.  The basic strategy was inspired by the writings of T.J.
Cloutier.

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>
The number of hands that Averybot will play is configurable.  Two
configuration sliders are available, one for preflop decisions and one
for postflop decisions.
