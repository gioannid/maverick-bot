<h1 align="center">Opponents</h1>
<p>
An opponent is a virtual poker player. They have a name, an engine (the 
particular Artificial Intelligence they use), various personal settings for 
their playing style, and a memory of hands they have played in 
the past. If you play the same opponent more than once, under the same profile
name, the opponent will recall how you played and may use that information
to adjust its playing style against you. Each opponent also has its own set of
statistics, which can be viewed in the <a href="statistics.html">Player
Statistics</a> window.
</p>

<h3>Opponent Manager</h3>

<p>
To manage your opponents, Poker Academy provides an <i>Opponent Manager</i>
which you can use to create, delete, import, export, and customize
your computer opponents.
</p>

<p>
The Opponent Manager can be accessed with the <i>Opponent Manager</i>
menu item under Poker Academy's <i>Window</i> menu (or alternatively,
using the menu shortcut <i>Ctrl+O</i>). 
</p>

<p>
The Opponent Manager window is broken up into two parts, 
the <i>Choose Opponent</i> section on the left, and the 
<i>Opponent Settings</i> panel on the right.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Choose Opponents</b> - Displays a list of engines and bot profiles for 
all opponents in Poker Academy.  The list is displayed in a tree sorted 
by betting type and engine name.  The control buttons on the left allow 
you to create, delete, import, and export opponent profiles.  Alternatively,
for each selected opponent, right-clicking also brings up a popup menu with
similar controls to duplicate, delete, or export the selected individual 
opponent or engine.

<p>
<b>Opponent Settings</b> - Selecting an opponent from the tree on
the left hand side of the <i>Opponent Manager</i> displays the
specific and configurable settings available for that opponent on 
the right hand side of the manager.  Using this panel, you can make 
changes to your bot profile and adjust specific settings based on the 
bot engine.  The settings for each of the engines are discussed 
specifically below.  Every bot must have a unique name, which can be 
edited at the top of the Settings panel.  When you make a change to 
the opponents settings, the save button will become enabled on the 
top right side of the panel to allow you to save the profile to disk.  
Beside the save button is a 'reset to default' button that will return 
your bot to its original profile.
