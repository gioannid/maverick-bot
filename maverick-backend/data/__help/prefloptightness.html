<h1 align="center">Limit Pre-flop Tightness Settings</h1>

<p>
The tight, moderate, and loose settings can all be thought of relative to each other as a
way of describing how many hands a computer opponent will consider playing.  That is, it 
is a way of controlling how many hands a player will fold or not fold.  Amongst these three 
settings, the tight setting plays the least number of hands, the loose setting plays the
most number of hands, and the moderate setting plays some number of hands in between.

<p>
The loose-passive setting sets the preflop style of play to be even looser than the loose
setting mentioned above and also causes the computer opponent to prefer passive actions such 
as checking and calling. This is a useful setting to try when you want your computer opponents
to play more like certain low limit players that have the style of playing a lot of hands
but mostly by checking and calling.

<p>
The fifth setting, the Small Stakes Advisor setting, is probably the setting that results in
the tightest most aggressive style of play preflop.  The play that results when using this
setting is based on advice (specifically, the loose table recommedations) given in the excellent 
book "Small Stakes Hold'em: Winning Big With Expert Play" which was written by Ed Miller, 
David Sklansky, and Mason Malmuth.
