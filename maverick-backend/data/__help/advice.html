Advice is intended for use by novice players. Advice can be left
permanently visible, or it can be hidden so that it only appears 
when you move your mouse cursor over the shield graphic hiding it. 
Clicking in the advisor pane will toggle showing or hiding the current 
advice.

<p>
The advisor acts like another computer player that sits behind you and
lets you know what it would do if it were in your shoes. Don't assume that
the advice is always correct, or that it is the only way to play. It is simply
an example of how one of the computer opponents would play the hand. 
<p>
The advisor will help novice players recognize when it is appropriate to 
raise a strong hand, call with draw odds, or learn which starting hands 
should be played and which should be avoided. Advanced players will not 
find the advice feature to be of much use. 
<p>
Suggestions of actions to make are shown as both a pie-chart, and as
percentages for folding, calling, and raising. The percentages reveal 
how <i>often</i> the advisor thinks the action should be taken. For instance,
if the advisor says fold 80% and raise 20%, it is probably suggesting that
it would normally fold this hand, but that 20% of the time it would raise
as a bluff.
<p>
If you were to always choose the maximum percentage displayed as your action,
your play would be quite straightforward and transparent. This style of play 
would be easily exploitable.

<p>
You can choose which bot profile you want for your advisor on 
the second page of the advisor panel.  This page can be accessed by clicking
the little arrow in the title bar of the panel. A different advisor can be chosen
for both limit and no-limit games. 
<p>
The third page (which again can be accessed through the arrow in the title bar of the
panel) lets you enable or disable all of the pop-up advice warnings.
The pop-up advice warnings are rule-based triggers that will pop-up when
we feel you may be about to make a big mistake such as folding a very strong
draw or failing to bet the nuts on the river. Each different warning can be
disabled individually when they are triggered. This lets you re-enable all
warnings or turn them all off completely.
