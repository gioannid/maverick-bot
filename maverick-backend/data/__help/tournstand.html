<h1 align="center">Tournament Standings Window</h1>
The <i>tournament standings window</i> is an auxiliary window that 
can be opened when you are playing a tournament. This window provides
useful information about the tournament that is updated in real-time
as you play to help keep you informed on the current state of the 
tournament. 

<p>
Once a tournament is started, this window can be opened manually by 
selecting the <i>Tournament Standings...</i> menu item under the 
<i>Lobby</i> menu in the main application window (or, by using the 
Ctrl-T key shortcut). Depending on your preferences, this window can 
also be set to open automatically once a tournament starts by 
selecting the <i>Show window at tournament start</i> checkbox located 
on the <i>Options</i> tab of the <i>Tournament Standings Window</i>
itself. By default, this option is selected so it will automatically 
appear at the start of each tournament you play.

<p>
The <i>tournament standings dialog</i> has its information separated
out into six different tabs: <i>Summary</i>, <i>Standings</i>, 
<i>Stacks</i>, <i>Levels</i>, <i>Payouts</i>, <i>Options</i>.

<h3>Summary Tab</h3>
The <i>Summary</i> tab contains some very useful summary information
about both the tournament itself and how you are currently doing. At
the top is the title of the tournament you are playing.  This title
is the same title that appears in the lists of tournaments that you
use to choose a tournament to start in the <a href="tournlobby.html">Tournament Lobby</a>.

<p>
Following the title are the following entries:
<ul>

<dl><dt>Buy In:</dt><dd>your buy in for the tournament.
	          Format for the buy in is the total amount of the buy in
	          followed by its breakdown of prize pool and house fee
	          amounts respectively.  So, a buy in entry that says
	          $6 ($5 + $1) means that it cost you $6 to enter the
	          tournament of which $5 goes to the prize pool that can
	          be won and $1 goes to the house as some sort of fee
	          that is not allowed to be won.</dd>
<dt>Prize Pool:</dt><dd> Total number of dollars available to be won 
	                   in tournament.</dd>
<dt>Positions Paid:</dt><dd> Number of finishing spots where a player 
	                       wins money.</dd>
<dt>Ranking:</dt><dd>Your current ranking in the tournament out of the 
	                total number of entrants.</dd>
<dt>Players Left:</dt><dd> Number of players not busted out of the total 
	                     number of entrants.</dd>
<dt>Next Position Pays:</dt><dd> The prize given to the next player to bust.</dd>
<dt>Chips in Play:</dt><dd> The total number of chips in the tournament.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The next section tells you the size of the largest, average, and
smallest chip stacks left in the tournament.

<p>
The next section gives you information specific to your chip stack
including the size of your chip stack, its percentage of the total
chips still in play, its ratio in regards to the size of the average
stack, and its ratio in regards to the size of the current big blind
size.

<p>
The next section lets you know the current level of the tournament
and the size of the ante if there is one as well as the 
corresponding blinds for the level.

<p>
The final section contains a quick summary paragraph of additional
tournament information including things like the number of chips each
player started with and how fast the levels increase.


<h3>Standings Tab</h3>
The <i>Standings</i> tab contains a standings table where every 
row shows some summary information for every player that entered
the tournament. There are four columns in the table: <i>Place</i>, 
<i>Name</i>, <i>Chips</i>, <i>Result</i>. Rows are sorted in 
ascending order by each player's place in the tournament.  The
standings table is color coded to visually separate areas of the
table.  Green rows indicate players that have not yet busted out
of the tournament while red rows indicate players that have
busted.  Each color can appear in either a lighter or darker shade
as well, and the lighter shade is used to indicate places that
are in the money (either tentatively, if that player is not yet
busted, or guaranteed, if that player has busted) and the darker shade
is used to indicate places that did not make the money.  In addition,
your entry in the table will appear in bold text to make it easier
to find. 

<p>
The <i>Place</i> column contains each player's current ranking in
the tournament. A player's place is primarily determined by their
chip count. The higher the player's chip count, the higher their
place in the tournament standings. For player's that are not busted
this place is their tentative ranking amongst all entrants in the
tournament. As players bust, their tentative ranking turns into
a finishing place since they are no longer active in the tournament.
For players that bust, the hand on which they busted out on is used 
to determine their finishing place. If more than one player busts 
out on the same hand, their chip counts at the start of the hand are 
used to break ties for finishing places. If more than one player 
should bust on the same hand and have the same number of chips at
the start of that hand, then those players finish tied for the
same place. The <i>Name</i> column contains each player's name. The 
<i>Chips</i> column contains each player's chip count. The <i>Result</i> 
column contains the amount of profit or loss the player made
by entering the tournament and finishing in their particular finish
place. The <i>Result</i> column will only have filled in entries
for players that have actually busted out of the tournament.  

<h3>Stacks Tab</h3>
The <i>Stacks</i> tab contains a graphical plot of the chip counts
for all active players. The chip counts are presented from left to
right in ascending order. The heights of the chip counts are 
graphed proportional to the current chip leader. The stack 
corresponding to your chip count (or all chip counts tied with you)
will appear in a lighter color than all other chip stacks.  If you
want more information about a stack, you can hover over a bar and a
popup will appear letting you know the player's name and exact chip 
count represented by the bar. In addition, if the application
determines that the scale of the graph can allow additional information
to be presented, the graphical plot may contain a black horizontal line
to indicate how large the big blind is in proportion to the stacks (and
possibly additional horizontal white lines representing subsequent 
multiples of the big blind), as well as another black horizontal line 
representing what would be the height of the currently average stack.

<h3>Levels Tab</h3>
The <i>Levels</i> tab contains a table of all the levels that make
up the tournament. Each row in the table corresponds to a level in
the tournament and as a tournament progresses the current level
proceeds from the top of the table down towards the bottom of the
table. The current level's text is written in bold. The <i>Level</i>
column contains the level number. The <i>Blinds</i> column shows the
amount of the small blind and the big blind for that level. The 
<i>Ante</i> column shows the amount of the ante for the level.

<h3>Payouts Tab</h3>
The <i>Payouts</i> tab shows you the net prize for each non-zero
paying finishing spot in the tournament. Each row represents a payout
amount for a particular range of finishing spots. The <i>Place</i>
column shows the range of finishing spots corresponding to the
payouts in that row. The table is sorted in ascending order of
finishing places. The <i>Payout</i> column shows what percentage
of the total prize pool each player would win. The <i>Prize</i>
column shows the actual gross winnings each player would win.

<h3>Options Tab</h3>
The <i>Options</i> tab contains two options that allow you to
control how you want the <i>Tournament Standings Dialog</i> to
automatically open. If the <i>Show window at tournament start</i>
option is selected then the window will automatically open when
you start a tournament.  If the <i>Show window after each bust</i>
option is selected then the window will automatically open each
time some player in the tournament busts. The initial defaults
when you first get the program are set so that the window
automatically appears upon tournament start, but will not appear
each time a player busts.
