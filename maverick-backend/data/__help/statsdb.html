<p>
All hands played in Poker Academy are stored in a Hand History Database. 
The main Player Statistics window provides access to all of the hand 
history  and player analysis tools. This module lets you view 
<a href="history.html">hand histories</a>, <a href="stats-import.html">import hands</a>, track your session 
performance, view summarized reports 
on all of the players you've faced, and dive into 
<a href="statistics.html">specific player statistics</a>
such as bankroll graphs, action frequencies, and more.
<p>
The Player Statistics module contains three types of windows. The 
Hand History Database contains summary information on all 
of the players and sessions. <a href="history.html">Hand History Browsers</a> 
display the actual hands from a session. 
<a href="statistics.html">Player Stats Windows</a> can be loaded for each player 
you have played a hand with. Individual player stats windows contain information 
specific to that player.

<h3>Toolbar Buttons</h3>
Several common toolbar buttons are used throughout the statistics package. 
They typically apply an action to the currently selected row in a table. 
If nothing is selected, they apply to all rows in the table.  
<table id="defined">

<h3>Summary Tab</h3>
The Summary tab provides a quick at-a-glance summary of the entire 
database contents. The total number of hands, sessions, and players 
are given on the upper left. 
<p>
Totals for all of the different Sites found in the database 
are displayed in the table at the top. Currently only two sites 
are supported. <i>Poker Academy Pro</i> is the site under which 
all local games are played. <i>Poker Academy Online</i> is used 
for all hands played on our online servers. In the future, we will 
support importing of hand histories from other poker sites.

All players in the database are listed on the Players summary table. 
Heroes	(your personal profiles) are shown in bold. A <i>Show Heroes 
Only</i> check box allows you to filter out all players that are 
not Heroes. Likewise, you can also filter out all players that have 
not played a significant number of hands. For each player, it lists:
<dl>
 	<dt> Player </dt> <dd>The player's name</dd>
	<dt>  Site </dt> <dd> The site the player is from</dd>
	<dt> Dollars Won </dt> <dd> The net dollars won or lost over all ring game hands, and tournament earnings. Essentially, this is the player's bankroll.</dd>
	<dt> Rake Paid </dt> <dd> The amount raked from pots this player has won, or rake paid in tournament buy-in fees.</dd>
	<dt>  Hands </dt> <dd> The number of hands played.</dd>
	<dt> Ring Games </dt> <dd> The number of ring game sessions played.</dd>
	<dt> Tournaments </dt> <dd> The number of Tournaments played.</dd>
	<dt> Player Type </dt> <dd> The class of player (Hero, Human, or Bot)</dd>
</dl>

Selecting a player will enable two buttons on the right:
<table id="defined">
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="top">
		<img src="images/stats-icon.png" width="43" height="43">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		The Player Stats button will bring up a new window containing 
		detailed statistics on that player. (See the
		section on <a href="statistics.html">
		Player Statistics Windows</a> for more information).
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="top">
	<img src="images/hist-icon.png" width="43" height="43">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
	 The Hand History button 
	will bring up a Hand History window showing only the hands where 
	that player is listed. 
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
<div id="sidebar">
Note: As a short-cut, double-clicking a player's 
row will bring up a Player Stats window. 
</div>
<br>

<h3>History Tab</h3>
The History tab displays a list of all hands ever played. See the section 
on the <a href="history.html">Hand Histories Browser</a> 
for more information.

<h3>Session Tabs</h3>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/statsdb-ses-small.png" width="267" height="184">
<p>
There are four tabs for each of the four game types (Limit Ring, 
No-Limit Ring, Limit Tournament, No-Limit Tournament). Each tab displays
a list of the appropriate sessions at the top. The bottom half of the view
contains a list of all players from the selected sessions. Sessions can be
selected (control-click to select multiple sessions, or 
shift-click to select a range of continuous sessions). Clicking on any of
the column titles will sort the table by that column. Clicking the same
column title again will reverse the sorting order.


<h3>Menu Options</h3>

	   losing, and breaking even. The defaults are pastel green for
