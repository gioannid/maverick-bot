Imagine a five player game of $10/$20 hold'em, with the following five players:
Alice, Bob, Carl, Dave, and Eddie.

Alice has the dealer button so Bob posts the Small Blind of $5 and Carl posts
the Big Blind of $10. The cards are dealt, two to each player, face-down:

Now it is Dave's turn to act. Dave has three options. He may fold if he does not 
like his hand. He can call the outstanding $10 bet
made by Carl as the Big Blind. Or he may raise the stakes by $10 by putting a 
total of $20 into the pot. Dave looks at his hand and sees <i>Pocket Eights</i>, 
which he thinks are worth playing. Dave calls the $10 bet.

Now it is Eddies turn to act. He has the same options that Dave had.
He may <i>fold</i>, <i>call</i>, or <i>raise</i>. Having a weak starting hand, 
Eddie decides to fold,
and tosses his hand away. Eddie will spend the rest of the hand as
an observer. Now it is Alice's turn to act. She quickly calls the $10 bet 
as well with her two face cards. 
<p>
Since Bob has already put $5 in the pot
as the Small Blind, he only needs to put $5 more to call, or $15 more in
to raise the bet by $10. Bob, having a small <i>suited-connector</i> 
hand decides to call as well, and puts $5 more into the pot.

<p>
Now the action is on Carl. Since no one re-raised his Big Blind, he
can <i>check</i>, or if he wishes he can <i>raise</i> $10 more. Carl, having
a weak hand, decides to check. Technically, he also has the option
to <i>fold</i>, but it would be a very silly thing to do since by checking
he will get to see the flop for free.
<p>
The pre-flop betting round is now over since everyone had a chance to
call the outstanding bet (Carl's Big Blind). All of the chips in front 
of each player are swept up by the dealer and placed into the center
of the table.

<h3>The flop is dealt:</h3>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>
The first active player after the button is Bob, so Bob is first to act on 
the flop. Bob has a decent drawing hand. If the turn card is an eight or a
three, it will give him a Straight. Bob doesn't know that his draw is much
weaker than it appears. Three of the eights and one of the threes are being
held by Carl and Dave. Bob decides to try and get to the Turn as cheaply as
possible to see if he makes his draw. Bob checks.
<p>
Carl has a draw as well. Any deuce will make him a straight as well. Carl checks.
Dave has the pair of eights in the hole. He is a little worried about the Ace
on the flop, which would give a bigger pair to anyone holding a single Ace. There
is a high free-card danger here as well with possible straight draws and a spade
flush draw. Dave decides to bet to protect what may be the best hand. He can't
allow the other players to draw against him for free. 
<p>
Next to act is Alice (Eddie is skipped since he folded earlier). Alice can fold,
call the $10 bet made by Dave, or raise another $10. Alice decides to call the
$10. It is back to Bob again, who is now faced with the option
to fold, call, or raise. Bob decides to call the $10 in hopes of drawing to a 
straight. Carl is next, and decides to fold.
<p>
The flop betting round is now over since all players have acted since the 
last betting action made by Dave. 

<h3>The turn card is dealt:</h3>
<div align="center">

</div>

<p>
Bob is first to act since he is the first active player to the left of
the button. Bob has not made his straight draw, but he still can hope to make
his straight with the river card. He has also picked up a flush draw. Any
diamond on the river will give him a flush. Bob can check, or bet $20.
Recall that on the turn and river, all bets must be $20. Bob checks, hoping
to draw cheaply to the river. 
<p>
It has been checked to Dave, who decides to bet again. Alice can now
fold, call the $20 bet by Dave, or raise another $20, making it $40 to go. 
Alice has made a pair of Kings so she decides to be aggressive and raises $20.
The action is back on Bob, who must now pay $40 to continue in the hand. Bob
does some quick mental arithmetic to decide if he should fold or call:

<p id="example">
Bob figures that there are 15 cards in the deck that would make his hand very 
strong.Any eight or three would make a straight, and any diamond would make a flush. 
There are 9 remaining diamonds in the deck and 4 threes and 4 eights. He can't
count the three of diamonds or eight of diamonds twice since those would make
the flush, not the straight, so that gives 9 </i>outs</i> to the flush and
six outs to the straight. Bob can see 6 of the 52 cards in the deck, so
there are 46 possible cards that could be dealt on the river. This means that 32%
of the time (15/46), the next card will make his hand very strong, and likely
to win the showdown. Bob counts the money in the pot, which totals $130. 
If he calls, the pot will be $170. 32% of the time his $40 investment will win 
a pot of at least $170. The remaining 68% of the time his hand stays weak,
and he knows he will fold to any bets made in the next round, so 68% of the
time he will lose $40. The expected value for calling is (32 x $170) - (68 * $40)
 = $5440 - $2720 = +$2720. It is clearly profitable in the long run for Bob to
 call the $40. </p>
<p>
 With this knowledge, Bob decides he must call.
<p>
Dave must still call $20 to stay in the hand. Dave is knows that his hand is
in trouble. With Alice raising him, and Bob calling, his pair of eights is
no longer a contender. His only hope would be to hit one of the two remaining 
eights in the deck to make three of a kind. Little does he know that that would
give Bob his straight. With so few <i>outs</i> left, he decides to give up and 
fold. 

<h3>The river card is dealt:</h3>

</div><br>


Bob is first to act, being the first active player after the button. Bob
can check or bet. Since his draw did not materialize, and his hand is very
weak, he checks. Alice decides to check as well. The river round is over, 
and Alice and Bob must now showdown for the pot. Since Alice acted last, Bob
must show his hand first. He reveals his 7d6c. His best 5-card hand is a pair
of fives (5s 5c As Kd 7d). Alice reveals KhJd. Her best 5-card hand is two-pair,
Kings and Fives (Kd Kh 5s 5c As). Alice is awarded the $170 pot, and the hand
is over.
