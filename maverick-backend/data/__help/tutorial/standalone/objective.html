<h1>Object of the Game</h1>

<p>Poker Academy lets you play two different types of Texas Hold'em: ring games and
tournaments.</p>

<h3>Ring Games</h3>
<p>A ring game is also known as a cash game. Players sit down with a certain
bankroll and try to win chips off each other. The chips represent dollars
directly. There is no set ending and you can leave the table whenever you want.
The objective is to consistently win as many chips as you can off your fellow
players in the long run.</p>

<h3>Tournaments</h3>
<p>In a tournament each player buys in for a certain amount of money and receives a
set amount of tournament chips. These chips do not represent cash directly.
Players play until they have no chips left in front of them and they are
eliminated from the tournament. The number of people still in the tournament when
you get eliminated is your finishing position. Tournaments have a payout
structure where the top finishers are awarded prizes 
(for example the top ten places usually get money in a 100 player tournament).  
The objective in a tournament is thus to survive long enough to be
one of the players who recieve a prize. This is called "making the
money".</p>

<p>In general you play tournaments much the same way as ring games. Consistently
winning chips (your only goal in a ring game) is a good way to survive in a
tournament! However at certain points in a tournament (for example just before
you make it into the money) you will want to be aware that survival is your true
goal and adjust your strategy accordingly (for example not taking risks if someone
else appears all but certain to be eliminated before you).</p>
