<h1>Draws</h1>

<p>Knowing what your hand is after all seven cards (5 board cards + your hole
cards) are revealed is simply applying the rules of the game. More strategic is
knowing what your hand is likely to be before all the board cards are dealt.</p>

<h3>Made Hands</h3>

<p>A "made hand" is a hand where you have made at least a pair using at least one
of your hole cards. For example if you have Ah Kc and the board is [Kd 6c 3h] then you
have made a pair of kings. You have a strong hand already and while you'd like
to improve (to three kings for example) you feel that as long as the other
players don't improve you likely will win. Hand strength is a measurement of how
strong your made hand is.</p>

<h3>Drawing Hands</h3>

<p>A "drawing" hand is the opposite situation. You do not have a made hand and feel
you must improve in order to win. Knowing how likely your chances of improving
are is an important consideration when you decide whether to continue the hand
or fold. For example if the board was [Kd 6c 3h] as before and you hold 5 and a 4 then you
have a chance to improve to a straight if either a 2 or 7 lands on the turn or
river (this is called an open-ended straight draw). If you have a Queen and a 9 then you
can also improve to a straight, but you need both the turn and river to do it
for example Jack on the turn and 10 on the river (this is called a running inside
straight draw).</p>

<p>In the second case you are much less likely to improve to a straight and you
would be said to have a worse drawing hand. Thus you would be more
likely to fold the Queen and 9 than a 5 and 4 in this situation if you felt you were behind
and needed to improve in order to win.</p>

<p>Calling with draws
is more common in fixed limit poker as you know there is a maximum amount you
will have to pay to try and make your draws. In no limit poker draws are more
often either folded, or bet strongly as a semi-bluff with the idea that even if
you are called you have a good chance to win.</p>

<h3>Positive and Negative Hand Potential</h3>

<p>In addition to looking for and seeing your own draws, it's important to try to
see what kind of draws your opponents could be playing. Poker Academy takes
draws into account by showing you your hand potential and negative hand
potential (the number in brackets) in the sidebar. Your hand potential is the
chance that your hand, if it happens to be behind now, will improve to be the
best after the next card is revealed. Negative potential is the opposite; if you
are ahead what is the chance one of your opponents will overtake you. Note that
these numbers are the chances for the next card only. On the flop, if either the
turn or river could improve your hand you can approximate this by doubling that
number. It does not take into account the situations on the flop where you need
both the turn and river to improve. You can refer to Poker Academy's calculation
to check your own mental approximation of how strong your potential is.</p>
