<h1>Betting, Raising, Calling, Checking, and Folding</h1>

<p>Each possible action in a betting round is done for strategic reasons.</p>

<h3>Betting and Raising</h3>

<p>Betting refers to the making the initial bet to start a round.  Betting can be used to increase the
money in the pot, or to force players out of the hand. It is an aggressive
action used with strong cards, or cards you wish to represent as being strong.</p>

<p>Raising refers to increasing the bet size after someone else has bet. It is
similar in intent to betting, yet is even more aggressive because someone
has already shown strength first by betting.</p>

<h3>Checking, Calling, and Check Raising</h3>

<p>Checking refers to not making any action when there is no bet to you. You cannot
check pre-flop since there are the blinds who bet before the cards were dealt. This is
generally the most passive play, yet one you should use often with weak cards
as it costs you nothing and everyone may check the round allowing you a chance
to improve for free.</p>

<p>Check-raising however is among the most aggressive plays. That refers to
checking with the intention of raising when someone bets. It is risky because
everyone else could check and no money would go into the pot. This is
generally done with very strong hands, and in fixed limit generally done on the
turn where the betting size has increased.</p>

<p>Calling refers to equaling the current bet size. It is often used when you need
future cards to improve, or have a moderate hand and believe your opponent is
representing more than their actual strength by betting. It is a very passive
play, and in situations where you can't decide between calling and raising it is
generally better to raise. This is often thought of as giving people a
chance to fold. In many cases (especially in no limit) either raising or folding
is better than calling.</p>

<h3>Folding</h3>

<p>Folding refers to discarding your cards and not investing any more money in the
pot. It is one of the most important actions in poker. Limiting your losses is
every bit as important as raising to maximize your winnings, perhaps even more
so for new players.</p>

<h3>Playing on the River</h3>

<p>In fixed limit, playing with a moderate hand on the river against a single
opponent is different and happens often enough to be mentioned. In this case
folding is a very risky play--you have to be absolutely sure your opponent has
you beat. Folding to save a single bet could cost you an entire large pot, so
calling is often recommended. Betting a moderate hand on the river is not
recommended either. Better to check and call if your opponent bets. When he has
a weak hand you win the same amount since he would likely have folded to your
bet, if he has a strong hand you lose less since he was not able to raise you,
and if he bluffs you win an extra bet.</p>
