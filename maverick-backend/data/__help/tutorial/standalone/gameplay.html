<h1>Basic Game Play</h1>

<p>Texas Hold'em is a game played in rounds. In each round, also called a betting
round, you learn more about what your eventual hand is going to be. Each player
is allowed to make bets and the other players must equal those bets (calling)
increase the bet (raising) or fold their hand. All the money goes into the pot
and at the end of the hand whoever has the best poker hand wins it. Folding is
special in that it means you are not putting any further money into the pot and
that you can't win even if it turns out you would have had the best poker hand.</p>

<p>So there are two ways to win a hand: at the very end you have the best poker
hands of all the remaining players, or before the end all the other players fold
to you leaving you as the only person left.</p>

<p>We will describe first how the cards appear and you make your hand, and then
talk about how the betting works in detail.</p>

<h3>Round One: Pre-flop</h3>

<p>In the pre-flop round each player is dealt two cards. These cards are dealt
face-down and are private to each player. They are called your hole cards.</p>

<h3>Round Two: The Flop</h3>

<p>On the flop, three cards are dealt face up in the middle of the table. These
face-up cards are called the board.</p>

<h3>Round Three: The Turn</h3>

<p>On the turn, a single card is added face up to the board.--making a total of
four face-up cards.</p>

<h3>Round Four: The River</h3>

<p>On the river, another single card is added face up to the board.--making a total
of five face-up cards. This is the last round, and after betting on this round
is finished everyone remaining reveals their hole cards, and the best hand wins.</p>

<p>Remember too that if at any point everyone folds except for one player, that
player immediately wins the pot and you go on to the next game without seeing
any remaining rounds.</p>

<h3>Your Hand:</h3>

<p>Your hand is made up of your two face-down cards, plus the five face up cards on
the board. This is seven cards in total. With these seven cards you make the
best five card poker hand possible. Everyone uses the same five face-up cards
and adds their own two private hole cards.</p>
