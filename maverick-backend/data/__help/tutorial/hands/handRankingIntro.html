<h1 align="center">Poker Hands</h1>
<p>
When you enter a <i>showdown</i>, the ranking of each player's
hand is used to decide who wins the <i>pot</i>.  Therefore, it
is very important to understand how poker hands are made and
ranked.
</p>

<h3>Making the Best Five-card Hand</h3>
<p>
In Texas Hold'em, a poker hand is always the highest ranked 
five-card hand that can be made using any five card combination 
out the seven cards available to each player.  The seven cards 
available to each player include their two private <i>hole</i> cards 
and the five public <i>community (or board)</i> cards that
all players share.  To put this another way, a poker hand can 
contain zero, one, or both of a player's hole cards.  In the case 
where a player is using none of their hole cards, their entire 
poker hand is defined solely by the five public community cards, 
and this is commonly called "playing the board". 
</p>

<h3>Ranking a Poker Hand</h3>
<p>
Poker hands can be broadly categorized into types according to 
the <a href="../../hands.html">standard five-card poker hand types</a>.
Each of these hand types can be used to give a rough ordering
for poker hands: all hands belonging to a particular hand type
are ranked higher than all hands corresponding to types below 
it, and are ranked lower than all hands corresponding to types 
above it.  For example, any <i>Three of a Kind</i> beats any
<i>Two Pair</i>, but loses to any <i>Straight</i>.  The relative
ranking of these types is based on the relative likelihood of a 
hand of that type occurring when considering all possible five 
card combinations out of a standard deck of 52 cards.
</p>

<p>
In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are four suits:  
Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, and Hearts.  Within every suit there
are 13 ranks which are ordered from highest to lowest as 
Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Nine, Eight, ... , Two.
</p>

<p> 
In Texas Hold'em, unlike some other card games, all suits are 
considered equal and are not used to break ties in hands that
are equal except for suit differences.
</p>

<p>
For hands of the same hand type, the ranking of the hands within 
a hand type depends on the ranks of the cards making up the hands.
</p>

<h3>Hand Types</h3>

ranked to lowest are as follows:
