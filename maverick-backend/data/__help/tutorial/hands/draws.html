<h1 align="center">Draws</h1>

At any given stage in Texas Hold'em, it is important to know if your
hand can still improve.  The ways that a hand can improve are commonly 
called "draws", and the future community cards that can help your hand 
improve are often called "outs".  Here are some common drawing 
situations in Texas Hold'em:

<h3>Example #1:</h3>
<div id="example">
  <div align="center">
	 <b>Your Hand: Ac 2c, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flop: 7c 8c Qd</b><br><br>
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Ac.png">&nbsp;
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/2c.png">
	 &nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;
 	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/7c.png">&nbsp;
 	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/8c.png">&nbsp;
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Qd.png">
  </div><br>
On the flop you would have an Ace-high hand.  
However, because your hand contains four clubs, you are said to have 
a <b>flush draw</b> as well.
<br><br>
Any of the nine remaining clubs in the deck (there are 13 total and 
four have already been dealt, so 13-4 = 9 left) would improve your 
hand to a flush (and in this case, the best possible flush, the 
Ace-high flush).  These nine club cards would be considered your 
outs to make your flush on the turn.    
</div>

<br>

<h3>Example #2:</h3>
<div id="example">
  <div align="center">
	 <b>Your Hand: Ts 7h, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flop: 9d 8c Ah</b><br><br>
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Ts.png">&nbsp;
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/7h.png">
	 &nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;
 	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/9d.png">&nbsp;
 	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/8c.png">&nbsp;
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Ah.png">
  </div><br>
On the flop you have an Ace-high hand.  
However, because your hand contains four cards in a sequence 
(i.e. Ten through Seven), you are said to have an 
<b>open-ended straight draw</b>.
<br><br>
If a Jack or a Six appears on the turn, then you would make a 
straight (either a Jack-high straight or a Ten-high straight, 
respectively).  Since there are 4 Jacks, and 4 Sixes left in the 
deck, you have 8 outs available to make a straight on the turn.
</div>

<br>

<h3>Example #3:</h3>
<div id="example">
  <div align="center">
	 <b>Your Hand: Tc 9c, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flop: 7c 8c Ah</b><br><br>
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Tc.png">&nbsp;
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/9c.png">
	 &nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;
 	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/7c.png">&nbsp;
 	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/8c.png">&nbsp;
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Ah.png">
  </div><br>
On the flop you have an Ace-high hand.  
However, because your hand contains four cards in a sequence 
that are also of the same suit (i.e. Tc 9c 8c 7c), you are said 
to have a <b>straight-flush draw</b>.
<br><br>
This hand has great possibilities to improve.  The Jc or 6c 
gives you a straight-flush. Any of the other clubs give you a 
flush.  Any of the other Jacks or Sixes give you a straight.  
Adding up these cards means that there are 15 cards in the deck 
that will improve your hand to at least a straight on the turn.
</div>

<h3>Example #4:</h3>
<div id="example">
  <div align="center">
	 <b>Your Hand: Js Ts, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flop: 7c 8c Ah</b><br><br>
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Js.png">&nbsp;
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Ts.png">
	 &nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp;
 	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/7c.png">&nbsp;
 	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/8c.png">&nbsp;
	 <img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Ah.png">
  </div><br>
On the flop you have an Ace-high hand.  
However, because your hand contains four cards that span a 
five-card sequence that is missing a middle card 
(i.e. Jack through Seven with a missing Nine), you are said 
to have an <b>inside straight draw</b>, which is sometimes 
also called a <b>gutshot straight draw</b>.  Any of the four 
Nines left in the deck would be outs to give you a straight
on the turn.
