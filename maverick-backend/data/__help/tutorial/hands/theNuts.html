<h1 align="center">The Nuts</h1>
At any given stage in Texas Hold'em, the best possible five-card 
hand that can be made on the current board is called <i>the nuts</i>.  
Knowing the nuts at every stage in a poker hand is a useful skill 
that helps you assess the strength of your own hand.  Here are a
few examples:

<h3>Example #1:</h3>
<div id="example">
<div align="center">
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/7c.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/8c.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Qd.png">
	<br><b>Board: 7c 8c Qd</b><br><br>
</div>
The nuts on this board would be Three of a Kind, Queens which 
could be made if a player's hole cards were a pair of Queens.
</div>

<h3>Example #2:</h3>
<div id="example">
<div align="center">
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/7c.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/8c.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Qd.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Tc.png">
	<br><b>Board: 7c 8c Qd Tc</b><br><br>
</div>
Adding a Tc on the turn to the previous example's flop changes 
the nuts significantly.  With this new board the nuts are now 
a Jack-High Straight Flush which a player can make if they 
were holding hole cards of Jc 9c:<br><br>
<div align="center">
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Jc.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/9c.png">
</div>
<br>
The next best hand, or 
second-nuts, would be a Ten-high Straight Flush which can be 
made with the 9c 6c:<br>
<div align="center">
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/9c.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/6c.png">
</div>
<br>
One interesting thing to note about this example is that if a player 
is holding the 9c 6c, from their perspective they are holding 
the nuts since they know that when they have the 9c no other
player can make the Jack-high Straight Flush.
<br><br>
Aside from these two straight flush hands, the next strongest 
hands would be flushes starting with the Ace-high flush.  After 
the flushes, players can have straights as well. Any J9 hole
card combination other than the Jc 9c makes a player a 
Queen-high straight.  Players can make Ten-high straights as 
well with any 96 hole card combination other than 9c 6c.  
Following all these other hands, is the previous stage's nut
hand, a Three of a Kind, Queens, which is the highest 
Three of a Kind hand that can be made on this board.

<h3>Example #3:</h3>
<div id="example">
<div align="center">
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/7c.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/8c.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Qd.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/Tc.png">&nbsp;
	<img width="30" height="42" src="../../../../data/cards-small/8s.png">
	<br><b>Board: 7c 8c Qd Tc 8s</b><br><br>
</div>
Adding the 8s on the river to example 2's board adds to the 
complexity of the hand.  The nuts would still be the 
Jack-high Straight Flush, and the second-nuts would still be 
the Ten-high Straight Flush.  However, the ranking of hands 
after these two hands changes because of the fact that the 
community cards now contain a paired of rank (i.e. the two 8's).  
<br><br>
The second 8 on the river makes it possible for a player to have
Four of a Kind, Eights if they held pocket 8's, which would 
be a good enough hand to make the third-nuts.  The fourth-nuts 
would be a Full House, Queens Full of Eights, if a player held 
pocket Queens.  There are many other full house possibilities as 
well, and then these hands would be followed by various flushes, 
and then various straights.
