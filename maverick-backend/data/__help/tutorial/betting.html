<h3>Betting Rules</h3>

This section describes the rules and mechanics of a Hold'em betting round. 


<h4>Betting Limits</h4>

In Fixed Limit games all bet sizes are fixed to a specific amount. If the stakes
are $10/$20, this means that all bets and raises in the first two betting rounds
(the <i>pre-flop</i> and the <i>flop</i>) are $10, and all betting in the last
two rounds (the <i>turn</i> and the <i>river</i>) must be $20. The first 
number given in the stakes ($10) is commonly called a <i>small bet</i>, and the
second amount ($20) is called a <i>big bet</i>. The big blind, being a forced
pre-flop bet is always the size of a <i>small bet</i>, and the <i>Small Blind</i>
is typically half a small bet. In a $10/$20 game, the small blind would 
be $5.
<p>
In No-Limit Hold'em, there is no maximum bet size. A player may bet any amount
up to the size of their stack. All bets must be at least the size of the big-blind.
All raises must be at least as big as the previous bet or raise. 


<h4>Betting Actions</h4>
There are several types of betting actions that can be made in a betting round.
<dl>

<dt>Fold</dt>
<dd>A player may always fold their hand when it is their turn to act. A folded
hand is thrown into the <i>muck</i> and the player is no longer eligible to
win the pot. If all but one players fold, the hand is immediately over. The 
last remaining player wins the pot uncontested.<p></dd>

<dt>Check/Call</dt>
<dd>If a player wants to remain in the hand, but does not wish to increase the
stakes, they may <i>Call</i> the current amount they owe the pot to continue
playing. If the amount to call is zero, a <i>Call of zero</i> is referred to
as a <i>Check</i>. A common mistake new players often make is to <i>fold</i>
when they could check for free, and remain eligible to win the pot.<p></dd>

<dt>Bet/Raise</dt>
<dd>When a player wishes to wager chips to increase the stakes, he may <i>bet</i> 
the proper amount (there are some restrictions that we will discuss 
later). The first betting action in a betting round is called a <i>bet</i>, and
any subsequent bet is called a <i>raise</i>.<p> </dd>

</dl>

<h4>Betting Order</h4>
The betting always proceeds in clockwise order around the table, and starts 
with the first active player to the left of the <i>dealer button</i>. Active 
players are the players still remaining in the hand. Players that have folded 
their cards are no longer actively involved in the hand. Players may only act 
when it is their turn to do so. 

A player must either fold, call, or raise when it is their turn to act. To 
remain in the hand they must match the amount bet by other players. If a player
raises, all players must have a chance to fold, call the raise, or re-raise. 
Once all players have acted and there are no outstanding bets, the round is over.

<h4>Betting Caps</h4>
In fixed-limit poker there is usually a cap on the number of raises allowed
during a single betting round. Usually no more than three raises are allowed,
except when it is down to just two players remaining in the hand
(<i>heads-up</i>). No-Limit Hold'em does not typically have a cap on betting.

<h4>All-in</h4>
When a player runs out of chips at the table, and calls or bets with the last
of their chips, the player is placed <i>all-in</i>. An all-in player is no
longer active in the hand, but they are still eligible to win the current pot.
However, if remaining players continue betting, all future bets go into a new
pot (a <i>side-pot</i>), which the all-in player is not eligible to win. At the
show down, the players involved in the most recent side-pot showdown first, 
then the all-in player shows their cards for the main pot.
