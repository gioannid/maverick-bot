<p>
The Player Statistics tab allows you to select a player in
the Hand History Database and then look at detailed information
for that player.  The information in this tab is separated into
the following components:
<ul>
	<li><a href="#players">Players</a></li>
	<li><a href="#sessions">Sessions</a></li>
	<li><a href="#filters">Filter Games</a></li>
	<li><a href="#totals">Totals</a></li>
	<li><a href="stats-bankroll.html">Bankroll Graph and Graph Options</a></li>
	<li><a href="stats-actions.html">Actions</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="players"></a>Players</h3>
<p><center><img src="images/statsdb-player-list.png"></center></p>
<p>
The Players list allows you to select a specific player in the 
Hand History Database.  Selecting a player in the players list,
displays detailed information about that player on the Players tab.
</p>

<p>
Any player that has ever participated in a hand recorded in the
Hand History Database appears in the players list.  This includes
your own profiles, opponents you have faced while playing
Poker Academy Online, and computer opponents you have played in
Poker Academy ring games and tournaments.
</p>

<p><div id=sidebar>
Tip: To make it easier for you to find your own profiles (i.e. heroes), 
you can check the <i>Show Heroes Only</i> checkbox below the players 
list which causes the players list to be filtered to only display hero
profiles.
</div></p>

<h3><a name="sessions"></a>Sessions</h3>
<p><center><img src="images/statsdb-session-list.png"></center></p>
<p>
The Sessions list displays a list of sessions that the selected player 
in the player list has played.  If no filters are used, then all sessions
played by the selected player are shown.  Otherwise, only sessions matching
the filter criteria are shown.
</p>

<p>
Each session entry in the session list provides some summary information 
about the session:
<ul>
	<li>the starting <b>Date</b> of the session</li>
	<li>the <b>Site</b> where the session was played - this will be either 
	    <i>PA - Poker Academy 2.0</i> for ring games and tournaments
        played on your own computer, or 
        <i>PA Online - Poker Academy Online</i> for ring games and 
        tournaments played on the free Poker Academy internet servers</li>
    <li>the name of the <b>Table</b> played at during the session</li>
    <li>the size of the <a href="glossary.html#stakes"><b>Stakes</b></a> during the session</li>
    <li>the number of <b>Hands</b> in the session where the selected player was dealt cards</li>
    <li>the <b>Net $ Won</b> by the selected player during the session</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><div id="sidebar">
Tip: The columns in the session list can be sorted by clicking on the 
column title.
</div>
</p>


<p><div id="sidebar">
Tip: As a short-cut, double-clicking a session's row will bring up a 
<a href="history.html">Hand History Browser</a> for all hands in 
that session. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
In the sessions panel, there are toolbar buttons that
perform specific operations on the selected session entries.
If no session entry is selected, the buttons will apply to all rows
in the table.  The buttons and their operations are as follows:
<table id="defined">
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="top">
	<img src="images/hist-icon.png" width="43" height="43">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
	The Hand History button will bring up a 
	<a href="history.html">Hand History Browser</a>  
	showing only the hands in the selected sessions.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="top">
	<img src="images/export-icon.png" width="43" height="43">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
	Export transcripts of the hands in the selected sessions to a text file.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="top">
	<img src="images/del-icon.png" width="43" height="43">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
	Permanently deletes all of the hands in the selected sessions 
	from the database.
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3><a name="filters"></a>Filter Games</h3>
<p><center><img src="images/statsdb-session-filters.png"></center></p>
<p>
The Filter Games panel allows you to filter which sessions appear in
the session list.  For each checkbox, if it is selected, then sessions
of that type are allowed to be displayed in the session list.  If it
is not selected, then sessions of that type are not displayed in the
session list.  The four checkboxes are:
<ul>
	<li>Ring - filters ring game sessions</li>
	<li>Tourney - filters tournament sessions</li>
	<li>Limit - filters fixed limit sessions</li>
	<li>No Limit - filters no limit sessions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><div id="sidebar">
Tip: If you deselect both <i>Ring</i> and <i>Tourney</i>, or both
<i>Limit</i> and <i>No Limit</i> at the same time, your entire
session list will be filtered to be empty.
</div>
</p>


<h3><a name="totals"></a>Totals</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="images/statsdb-totals-lite.png"></p>
<p>
The Totals panel provides summary information for your selected
sessions including the total number of hands played by the
selected player in the sessions, and the amount of money that
player won in the selected sessions.
