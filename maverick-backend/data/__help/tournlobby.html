<h1>Tournament Lobby</h1>
<p>
The <i>Tournament Lobby</i> is the launching point from where you will select
tournaments to play. To start a tournament, first select one from the list on
the left hand side. You can select from many popular limit and no-limit
single and multi-table tournament structures, or any unfinished tournaments that
you were playing.

<h3>Pre-defined Tournament Structures</h3>
<p>
Poker Academy comes with a number of pre-defined tournament structures as well as 
tools to create and edit your own structures.  From the lobby you can 
<i>create</i>, <i>delete</i>, <i>restore to default</i>, <i>import</i>, <i>export</i>, and 
<i>save</i> your custom tournament structures.

<table id="defined">
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">

	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		Creates a new tournament structure that duplicates the settings of the 
		previous structure you had selected.  You will be prompted to enter a name, and 
		you must ensure that all tournament names are unique.

</table>


When you select a tournament structure from the list, the panel on the right hand
side will be updated to show various information about the selected tournament.
This includes the tournament name, tabs with various configurable settings, and a short 
description.  
</p>

<p>
The four tabs containing the configurable settings for the selected tournament
structure include: <i>Details</i>, <i>Structure</i>, <i>Players</i>, and <i>Payouts</i>.

<blockquote>
<h3>Details Tab</h3>

<!--
<p>
<center><img src="images/tournlobby-details-small.png"></center>
</p>
-->

The <i>Details</i> tab contains a description of your tournament along with
three editable sections: <i>Game Time Details</i>, <i>Buy-Ins</i>, 
<i>Players</i>.


<p>
<b>Game Time Details</b> - lets you adjust the starting values for three main settings:<br>
<i>Starting Chips</i> - lets you set the number of chips each player receives at the beginning
of the tournament.<br>
<i>Starting Players</i> - lets you adjust the number of players that will begin your tournament.  
This is the same as adjusting the slider above.<br>
<i>Players Per Table</i> - lets you set the number of maximum number of players that will
play at each table.  Heads up tournaments are not yet supported, 
so the minimun number of players per table is three.

<p>
<b>Buy-Ins</b> - lets you choose how much you want to buy into the tournament
for. The list of available buy-ins represents which buy-ins are allowed for
the structure.  These buy-ins are used for tracking your stats in tournament play
so you can calculate your return on investment.  To select the buy-in you wish
to use for your tournament, simply highlight the desired one before you start the
tournament.  Existing buy-ins can be edited by double-clicking on one of the numbers 
of the buy-in entry you wish to edit.  You can also add and remove buy-ins allowed 
for the particular structure by using the (+) and (-) buttons located to the right
of the buy-ins section.

<p>
<b>Players</b> - lets you set the minimum and maximum number of players allowed in
your tournament structure.  These minimum and maximum numbers represent the extreme
left and right numbers on the slider at the top.  Single table tournaments generally 
allow 2-10 players, while multi table tournaments generally allow 10 or more players.


<h3>Structure Tab</h3>

<!--
<p>
<center><img src="images/tournlobby-struct-small.png"></center>
</p>
-->

The structure tab allows you to edit the betting structure for the tournament including: 
<i>Start Level</i>, <i>Level Length</i>, <i>Betting Type</i>, and the <i>Level Editor</i>.

<p>
<b>Start Level</b> - lets you determine which level of the tournament structure
the tournament will begin at (i.e., instead of starting at the first level, you 
get to choose which of the beginning levels to skip). You can adjust
this number using the arrows, or by typing one in yourself. Each structure has
a different number of levels, and you may not exceed the last level of the
structure.

<p>
<b>Level Length</b> - allows you to choose how long each level in a tournament
will last. This can be based on <i>Minutes</i>, <i>Hands</i>, or <i>Busts</i>. Minutes
means the levels will increase after a given amount of actual playing time
has passed.  Actual playing time is accumulated hand by hand and recorded from 
the time when you first hit the deal button to the 
end of the hand. This means that if you leave the program in between hands
that time will not be considered when deciding when levels increase. 
Hands means the levels will increase after a given number of hands
have been played. Busts means the levels will increase after a given
amount of players have busted out of the tournament.  Since there can be more
than one bust per hand in the tournament, depending on the number of busts
that happen in a hand and the value of this setting, levels can actually be
skipped.

<p id="sidebar">
To simulate live play we recommend a setting of roughly 30 hands per 
hour of play.  (i.e., if your tournament raises blinds every 15 minutes, that would 
be roughly 8 hands per level)
</p>

<p>
<b>Betting Type</b> - lets you choose the betting type that will be used for the entire 
tournament.  No limit, means that you can bet up to your entire stack on any decision on any round, 
and the minimum bet has to be at least the value of the big blind.  Limit, means 
a fixed limit structure, where all bets and raises are fixed based on increments of the big blind.

<p> 
<b>Level Editor</b> - lets you edit the structure and blinds for your tournament.  Each level 
has three editable columns: Ante, Small Blind, Big Blind.  Double clicking on any of these columns 
will allow you to edit the appropriate value for that level.  When you edit the small blind of 
a given level, the big blind will automatically be set to twice the small blind.  Every tournament 
should have increasing blinds to force the action as the tournament progresses.  The only rule 
when making a custom tournament level is: the big blind must be greater than or equal to the small 
blind of that level.  Beyond that you are free to make any custom tournament structure you like.  
The (+) and (-) buttons located to the right of the level editor allow you to add / remove 
selected rows from the structure.  


<h3>Players Tab</h3>

<!--
<p>
<center><img src="images/tournlobby-players-small.png"></center>
</p>
-->

The <i>Players</i> tab lets you view and set the lineup for your tournament. Here 
you can select or configure which distribution of computer opponents or “bots” you would like to play
against.  A pull down box at the top allows you to select distributions or players stored 
on disk.  A table is also displayed which lists the opponents and the distribution percentage 
they will appear with in the tournament.  There are controls along the top that
allow you to <i>create</i>, <i>delete</i>, <i>save</i>, <i>import</i> and <i>export</i> player 
distributions.  There are also buttons on the side that allow you to <i>add</i> and <i>remove</i> 
rows from your distribution.

<table id="defined">
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/rg-but-create.png" >
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		Creates a new player distribution for the given betting type.  Creating a new distribution will 
		prompt you to enter a name, so you can easily select it later.  A default random 
		distribution will be created initally, which you can begin editing.

<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">

</table>


Poker Academy offers a few standard pre-defined player distributions for both limit 
and no-limit games.  To choose a new 
distribution, select one from the pull down box in the center above the players list.  
<p>
To edit a player distribution click any opponent to bring up a menu containing 
all of the players available for the selected type of game. The first level of 
this menu lists the Artificial Intelligence engines and the submenus list specific 
profiles based on these engines.  You can also choose to specify random bots from 
all AI engines, or choose random bots from specific AI engines, to help vary your 
tournament lineup.

<p id="sidebar">
Note: The <a href="opponents.html">AI Engines</a> are specific to the particular game
being played. Jagbot, Pokibot
and Simbot play only limit hold ‘em. Vexbot and Sparbot play only heads-up
limit hold ‘em. Jambot, Oddbot, Xenbot and Averybot play only no-limit hold‘em.
</p>

Once you have selected a "bot", you can edit its distribution percentage by 
double-clicking on the third column in the player list.  When you start your 
tournament the number of specific bots that appear will be based on the percentage 
you entered for it in the player list.  

<p id="sidebar">
Tip: You do not not have to worry about your percentages adding up to 100%, as 
all values will be normalized when the start button is clicked. For example, 
if I allocate two bots, (A) with 20%, and (B) with 10%, when I start the 
tourney I will expect to see 67% (A) bots, and 33% (B) bots in my lineup.
</p>

<h3>Payouts Tab</h3>

<!--
<p>
<center><img src="images/tournlobby-payouts-small.png"></center>
</p>
-->

The <i>Payouts</i> tab contains two sections: <i>Choose Payouts</i> and <i>Payout Viewer</i>.
<p>
<b>Choose Payouts</b> - lets you choose what payout scheme you would like to use for
your tournament.  Poker Academy has provided a variety of different payout schemes for 
different sized tournaments.  There are multi table tournament and sit n go payouts 
which will pay a certain number of players a percentage of the prize pool.  
As well, there are satellite payouts that will pay 1 winner for every 10, 20, or 50 players.  
Lastly, there is a winner take all payout scheme that will only pay the top place finisher.
Beside the payout chooser you can set the <i>Initial Prize Pool</i> and increase the 
ammount of money in the prize pool that the players are playing for.  Below is the value of 
the prize pool, and the current number of players in your tournament.  Adjusting the 
number of players using the slider above will alter the prize pool, and the corresponding payouts 
in the payout viewer.
<p>
<b>Payout Viewer</b> - Lets you view the payouts for the current tournament based on: 
the <i>Number of Players</i>, the <i>Buy-In</i> and the <i>Initial Prize Pool</i>.
There are three columns: Place, Payout, and Prize. The Place column shows the range of
positions the payouts correspond to for that row. The Payout column is the percentage 
of the total prize pool that each place in that range will receive. The Prize column
contains the amount of dollars each place listed in that row will receive.
</blockquote>

<h3>Unfinished Tournaments</h3>

If any unfinished tournaments are available for you to resume, they will appear
at the top of the list on the left hand side of the <i>Tournament Lobby</i>.

<br>
<br>
<center>
	<img src="images/tl-unfinished-small.png">
</center>
<br>

Unfinished tournaments will appear categorized based on whether they were 
no-limit or limit and single-table or multi-table tournaments. Unfinished 
tournaments are automatically saved for you when you stop playing  
and the tournament has not finished or you have not busted.  There is only one 
control button for unfinished tournaments: <i>delete</i>

<table id="defined">
	<tr>
		<td><img src="images/rg-but-trash.png"></td>
		<td>Deletes the current unfinished tournament from disk.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

When you select an unfinished tournament, the title of your tournament
appear on the right side of the screen along with the date you started
it. Below the name is a bit of information about your tournament: the prize
pool, buy-in, your ranking, players left, elapsed time, and starting chips. Below
this are four tabs with more information about your unfinished tournament:
Standings, Summary, Levels, and Pay-outs.

<blockquote>
<h3>Standings Tab</h3>

The <i>Standings</i> tab shows you a list of all players in your tournament, 
how many chips they have left, and any payouts they have received.


<h3>Summary Tab</h3>

The <i>Summary</i> tab displays a short description of your tournament, with 
information about the starting chips, level length, and the current level and
blinds. Also present is information comparing your chip stack with all
the chips in play, the average chip count, and the amount of the big
blind. This information is crucial to help determine how well you were doing
in the tournament when you stopped playing it. Below that is a chart of how the 
largest, average, and smallest stacks compare.

<h3>Levels Tab</h3>

The <i>Levels</i> tab displays the levels and structure of your tournament. The 
Level Number, Blinds, and Antes are shown. The blinds will increase as the
level number increases. Some tournaments will not have antes. This list
is fixed upon tournament start.

<h3>Payouts Tab</h3>

The <i>Payouts</i> tab displays the payout information for your tournament. The
place is the position a player finishes. Payout is the percentage of the
prize pool that place will receive. Prize is the dollar amount that place
will receive. This list is fixed upon tournament start.
