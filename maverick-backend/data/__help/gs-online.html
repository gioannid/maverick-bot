To start an Online game, first select "Poker Academy Online" from the 
<a href="gs-mainlobby.html">main lobby</a> to reach the online lobby.
<p>
Note that you must be connected to the Internet to use Poker
Academy Online.

<h3>Connecting to the Online Lobby</h3>

The first thing you must do is decide on an online username.  Usernames
should be less than 12 characters and can only contain letters, numbers, 
spaces, and decimals. Spaces at the start or end of your username are 
ignored.
<p>

Although you don't type in a password, the program uses the CD Key
you entered after installing and makes sure each CD Key can only be 
used once online. Don't lend out your CD Key or you may be unable to play!

<h3>Joining a Room</h3>

Once you are connected the <i>Online Lobby Window</i> will appear. This window
contains a variety of information for Poker Academy Online.

<blockquote>
<h3>The Room Chooser</h3>
The Room Chooser contains a list of all of the active rooms online. By default,
all rooms are displayed, but there are tabs along the top to choose to show only
certain sub-categories (limit, no-limit, tournament, and private). To sit down 
at a table select one of the rooms and press "Join Room", or double-click it.
Selecting a room will display more information about that room below the room
chooser, including what players are currently in the room.

<h3>News Tab</h3>

and freerolls, the latest news is displayed in the <i>News</i> tab.

<h3>Account Tab</h3>
The <i>account</i> tab shows the status of your online bankroll. For more
information on how online bankrolls work, see our section on

<h3>Lobby Chat</h3>
A public lobby chat area is provided. Players can use this to organize where
to play, or to just chat about poker.
</blockquote>

<h3>Starting Online Play</h3>

Playing online is similar to playing against the computer
opponents. For a ring game, the first step is to click on one of the 
empty seats that says "Select Seat" on it. You wil not be able to join 
a tournament that has already started or a game with ten players already 
seated. When joining a tournament, a registration screen appears. Click
the register button to claim a seat in the tournament.
<p>

When you are seated in a room, play begins when the room creator
presses the "Start Tournament" button (in the case of a tournament)
or when the minimum number of players is reached (in the case
of a ring game).
