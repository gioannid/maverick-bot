<h1 align="center">Sidebar: Tournament Stats</h1>
When you are playing in a tournament, a <i>Tournament Stats</i>
section will appear in the <i>Sidebar</i> that allows you quick
access to some tournament summary information.

<p>
On the header for the <i>Tournament Stats</i> section of the
<i>Sidebar</i>, you will see a left pointing arrow on the 
left hand side and you will see a up or down pointing arrow on the
right hand side.  The up or down pointing arrow on the right
hand side of the header expands and contracts the section to make
it visible or hide it.  The left pointing arrow on the left hand
side allows you to flip between two available subpanels containing
two different types of tournament summary information: 
<i>Summary Subpanel</i>, and <i>Stack Subpanel</i>. 


<h3>Summary Subpanel</h3>
When the <i>Summary Subpanel</i> is the currently chosen subpanel,
the header of the <i>Tournament Stats</i> section of the <i>Sidebar</i>
will read "Tournament".  When this panel is visible, it contains
summary information that will tell you the prize pool of the tournament,
your current ranking, the number of players still active in the tournament,
and the sizes of the largest, average, and smallest stacks respectively.

<h3>Stacks Subpanel</h3>
When the <i>Stacks Subpanel</i> is the currently chosen subpanel,
the head of the <i>Tournament Stats</i> section of the <i>Sidebar</i>
will read "Tournament Stacks".  This subpanel contains a graphical 
plot of the chip counts for all active players. The chip counts are 
presented from left to right in ascending order. The heights of the 
chip counts are graphed proportional to the current chip leader. The 
stack corresponding to your chip count (or all chip counts tied with you)
will appear in a lighter color than all other chip stacks.  If you
want more information about a stack, you can hover over a bar and a
popup will appear letting you know the player's name and exact chip 
count represented by the bar. In addition, if the application
determines that the scale of the graph can allow additional information
to be presented, the graphical plot may contain a black horizontal line
to indicate how large the big blind is in proportion to the stacks (and
possibly additional horizontal white lines representing subsequent 
multiples of the big blind), as well as another black horizontal line 
representing what would be the height of the currently average stack.
