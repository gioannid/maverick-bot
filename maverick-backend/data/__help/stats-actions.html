<h1 align="center">Actions</h1>

<p align="center"><img src="images/statsdb-actions.png"></p>
<p>
The Actions tab graphically shows information about the selected player's
actions over the selected sessions.  The upper portion of the tab breaks
down the player's action frequencies by each Texas Hold'em round:
Pre-Flop, Flop, Turn and River.  The lower portion of the tab shows four
other key statistics for the selected player on graphical scales: 
Pre-Flop Played %, Went to Showdown and Won %, Pre-Flop Aggression, and 
Post-Flop Aggression.
</p>

<h3>Action Frequencies By Stage</h3>
<p><img src="images/statsdb-actions-circle.png"></p>

<p>
The Action Frequencies By Stage portion of the Actions tab graphically
shows how often a player takes each type of action in each stage of the
game.  This information is shown using four pie charts with associated 
percentages for each stage in Texas Hold'em: Pre-Flop, Flop, Turn, and River.
</p>

<p>
Each pie chart is color-coded to show frequencies for each of the four
action frequencies tracked.  Fold is shown in red, Call in dark blue,
Check in light blue, and Bet in green.  The relative size of each 
colored section in the pie represents the percentage of time the selected 
player has taken that action in the selected sessions.  These percentages
are also listed explicitly beside each pie chart. 
</p>

<p>
If a pie chart is an empty circle, then that means that the selected 
player has never made an action on that stage in the selected sessions.
When this happens, the percentages shown with each action are shown
as being "n/a" (i.e. not available).
</p>

<p>
In the bottom left corner of each stage's frequency information is a
number that is used to indicate how often a player reaches that particular
stage in the game.  In the Pre-Flop panel, the number represents the 
number of hands dealt.  In the three other Post-Flop panels 
(flop, turn, and river), the number in the corner represents the percentage of
time that player went to that stage.  It is important to note that during
all-ins a player can reach a stage but not actually get to make an action 
there.
</p>

<p>
The frequency information presented here is useful when trying to 
identify patterns in a player's betting habits.  For example, this 
information is useful if you want to see if a player is calling too 
much on the flop only to fold on the turn.
</p>

<h3>Key Stats with Graphical Scales</h3>
<p><img src="images/statsdb-actions-bar.png"></p>

<p>
The lower portion of the Actions tab graphically presents some key
statistics for the selected player as observed in the selected sessions.
For each key statistic, there is a graphical scale that represents a
valid range for the value of that statistic.  The selected player's 
value for that statistic is shown as value inside the scale.
</p>

<p>
To make it easier to interpret the graphical scale, they are colored
in a specific manner to draw your attention to different areas.  Each
extreme end of the scale is colored a specific color and a gradient is
used blur the two colors together as they approach one another.  Somewhere
within the scale, there will be a white highlighted region that is
distinctly bright at some point and fades out to the extreme colors.
This white highlighted region is meant to indicate a suggested range 
where the player's actual value should be situated.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that the accuracy of these stats, as with all 
stats, will have more significance as more hands are played.  Also note, 
analyzing these stats across different game types (number of players, 
types of players, betting type (e.g. limit or no limit), and game type
(e.g. ring or tournament)) may produce poor statistical significance.
</p>

<p>
These graphical scales are useful to use when you want to compare different
players to try and identify which characteristics are important for making
players winners or losers.
</p>

<p>
The key statistics shown are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Pre-Flop Played %</dt>
  <dd>The percentage of hands where the selected player voluntarily contributed 
  chips to the pot (i.e. chips put into the pot not including blinds or antes).  
  That is, this is the number of hands the player called or raised before the 
  flop out of the total number of hands dealt. This statistic is extremely useful
  to determine how loose (plays many hands) or tight (plays few hands) a player is.
  For newer players, it is good to play tighter, while you learn and watch others play.
  At a full table (10 players), it is also better to play tighter.  When there are less
  players at the table you need to play more hands.  Note, it is possible for a 
  player to see the flop without voluntarily putting any money in the pot.  For example,
  this can happen if they post the big blind and the pot is not raised.  Also note, the
  suggested range (in white) is for a tight - average player in a 10 handed limit game.
  </dd>

  <dt>Pre-Flop Aggression</dt>
  <dd>Aggression shows a player's betting tendencies.  Aggression is calculated by: <br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(number of raises + number of bets) / number of calls </i><br>
      The more a player bets the more aggressive they are. The more a player calls the 
      more passive they are.</dd>
  
  <dt>Went to the Showdown and Won %</dt>
  <dd>The number of hands won at during showdowns out of the number of hands taken to showdowns.  
      If this value is 100%, the selected player has won every single showdown they have seen in 
      the selected sessions.
      If this value is 0%, the selected player has lost every single showdown they have seen in 
      the selected sessions.
  </dd>
      
  <dt>Post-Flop Aggression</dt>
  <dd>Post-Flop Aggression is calculated according to the same formula shown above in the description
      of the pre-flop aggression statistic.  Post-flop aggression, however, considers player
  	  actions on all three post-flop stages together to determine the value of this statistic 
  	  (i.e. flop, turn, and river). Pre-Flop and Post-Flop aggression are separated into
  	  separate stats because players tend to play differently pre-flop and post-flop.
