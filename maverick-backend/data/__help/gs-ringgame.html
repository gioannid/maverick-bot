<h1 align="center">Getting Started: Ring Games</h1>

To start a Ring Game you first select "Ring Games" from the 
<a href="gs-mainlobby.html">main lobby</a> to enter the 
ring game lobby.

<h3>Table Selection</h3>
On the left side of the Ring Game Lobby is a tree view which 
contains a number of pre-configured limit and no-limit tables. 
You can choose to play against a full complement of computer 
opponents, a short-handed game or heads-up.

Once you select a table, the table information view
on the right shows you the opponents, a comment describing in 
general terms what to expect of the table,
and the stakes.  

<h3>Profile Selection</h3>

Underneath the list of tables on the left is the profile 
selection box. You can select a profile to use or create a
new one.  <a href="profiles.html">Profiles</a> are used by the 
statistics system to track your progress, and used by the bots to 
learn how you play.

<h3>Launch the Game</h3>

Underneath the opponent list you will find the starting bankrolls, 
the stakes, and the rake. 
These can be edited and will be remembered as the defaults for all tables.
<p>
Under the table information screen on the right is the 
<i>Load Table</i> button. Click that to start playing!
