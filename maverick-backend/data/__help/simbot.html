<h1 align="center">Simbot</h1>

Simbot is a derivative of <a href="poki.html">Poki</a>. 
Instead of using Poki's formula-based betting strategy to make decisions, 
it runs simulations of the hand to completion, and determines the most 
profitable action to make based on the outcomes.

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

<h4>Pre-flop Settings:</h4>
There are five tightness levels to choose from (tight, moderate, loose, 
loose-passive, and small stakes advisor). See
<a href="prefloptightness.html">Preflop Limit Tightness Settings</a> for detailed information 
on these settings.
<p> 
The pre-flop deception level lets you choose how much randomization it will 
use in pre-flop actions. If you set the slider towards <i>honest</i> it 
will raise with strong hands, call with moderate strength hands, and fold 
everything else. With high deception (<i>tricky</i>) it will have a 
higher chance of calling strong hands and even some very weak hands, and
will raise some moderate hands. 

<h4>Post-flop Settings:</h4>
For post-flop play there are two sliders.
The first slider controls how much it will use its opponent modeling 
information in assigning cards for the simulation. This sets the style 
to either 'play the man' or 'play the cards'.
<p>
The second slider controls what types of actions the simulated opponents 
will do during the trails. If set to <i>Call</i>, the simulation becomes a
basic all-in equity simulation. If the slider is moved towards <i>Predict</i>
then it will use its opponent models to try and predict what each opponent
would do in each simulated situation.
