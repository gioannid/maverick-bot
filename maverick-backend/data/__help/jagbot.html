<h1 align="center">Jagbot</h1>

Jagbot is a simple, rule-based strategy. It uses no opponent modeling.
It only evaluates the strength of its own hand, and uses a simple formula
to choose a randomized action. 
<p>
Since Jagbot does relatively little calculation (compared to the more complex 
opponents), it is a good choice if you want to play a very fast-paced game,
especially on a older computer. 
<p>
If you are a novice poker player, Jagbot is also a good player to start 
training with. You might want to play a table full of Jagbot players 
if you find the regular tables too difficult.
<p>

<i>Moderate</i>, <i>Loose</i>, <i>Loose-Passive</i>, or <i>Small Stakes Advisor</i>. See
