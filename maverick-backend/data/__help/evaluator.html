The Hand Evaluator can compute and summarize a detailed evaluation
of any Hold'em hand. Custom cards can be entered along the top by 
clicking on each of the card buttons. Once hole cards have been 
entered, some statistics become immediately available. For instance,
the draws to the flop, turn, and river, for that hand will be shown
under the <i>draws</i> tab. 
Most calculations, however, also require board cards to be entered as well. 

<h3>Strength</h3>
When the Hand Evaluator is open, the Strength tab will display the
results of a running simulation that determines the percentage of
the pot you will win on average against each of 1 to 9 opponents.
The percentage of the pot that you will win is typically referred
to as your <i>equity</i> in the pot.  
<p>
Your equity in the pot takes into account how often you would win a 
pot outright, how often you would lose the pot, and how often you 
would tie and end up sharing the pot with your opponents.  For example, 
if you will always win the pot outright, then you are said to have 
100% equity.  If you will always lose the pot, then you are said to 
have 0% equity.  If you will always tie against one opponent, then 
you have 50% equity.  If you will always tie against two opponents,
then you have 33% equity.  If you win the pot outright half the time, 
and lose the pot outright the other half the time, you have 50% equity.
If you win the pot outright one third of the time, and lose the pot
outright two thirds of the time, you have 33% equity.
<p>
In the simulation results shown, all unspecified board cards are
randomly generated in each simulation. This gives you an
estimate of your <i>all-in equity</i> since the results correspond
to what happens when you are all-in against your opponents and you
get to see all the remaining board cards.  Because these simulations
automatically generate the remaining board cards for you, the
simulations will start running as soon as you specify any of your
cards.
<p>
In each trial of the simulation, each opponent is assigned hole 
cards according to the distribution of hands indicated by the currently 
selected opponent preflop tightness bias.  The opponent preflop 
tightness bias can be selected using the slider at the bottom of the 
Hand Evaluator window.  This slider is explained in more depth in 
the <a href="#bias">Bias tab</a> description below.
<p>
At the bottom of the Strength panel, the hand's pre-flop hand ranking
is also given. The pre-flop hand rank was determined by simulating 
millions of hands and computing the performance of each starting hand.
The best hand (AA) is ranked #1, while the worst hand (72o) is ranked 
#169.

<h3>Draws</h3>
The Draws panel shows the probability of making a draw to each 
type of hand on each betting round. If the betting round is already
passed, the hand type that was made in that round is marked with
an asterisk. 
<p>
<i>Positive Potential</i> is the probability that if you are 
currently behind, the next card to come will make your hand 
the best.
<br>
<i>Negative Potential</i> is the probability that if you 
currently have the best hand, that the next card to come 
will put you behind. 


<h3>Hands</h3>
The Hands panel shows the probability of your opponents currently
having various types of hands. <i>Uniform</i> weighting gives an 
exact count with all hands considered equally likely. <i>Biased</i> 
probabilities are skewed toward hands that were more likely to be
played preflop.
<p>
The nuts (the best possible hand) is also displayed on this screen.


<h3><a name="bias">Bias</a></h3>

The Bias tab lets you configure the amount
of bias to use in the calculations that appear in the
<i>Strength</i> and <i>Hands</i> tabs. 
<p>
On the left is a 13x13 matrix which represents all 169 
starting hands types. Each cell is shaded to represent
the current weighting it receives. The darker a cell,
the more weight it is given in the calculations. 
<p>
The slider bar changes the estimated pre-flop tightness of 
your virtual opponents. If you drag the slider all the way 
to the left, the entire table becomes black. This means that 
your opponents would see the flop with any two cards, and 
the biased values will be identical to <i>uniform</i> weighting. 
If you move the slider all the way to the right, only hands like
AA, KK, and AK suited are probable.
<p>
The histogram on the bottom right shows the distribution of hand 
ranks for all of the 1081 opponent hands, weighted by the probability 
that the hand was played (from the weight table). All of the bars 
drawn in grey are hands that are worse than your hand. The bars 
drawn in red represent all of the opponent hands that are better 
than your hand.  The distribution depends on the tightness 
of your opponents and will change as you move the slider.
<p>
The x-axis is the strength of the opponent hands (with the weakest hands
to the left and strongest to the right). The height of each bar shows
the relative proportion of hands for each strength class.
