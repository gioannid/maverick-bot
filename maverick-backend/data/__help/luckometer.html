<h1 align="center">Luckometer Analysis</h1>

Ever wonder how much of your success is from good play, 
and how much is from luck? The Luckometer is a tool for
objectively measuring the quality of the cards you are
being dealt, verses your opponents. 
<p>
The luckometer is intended to answer the following 
question: What quality of cards have I been dealt,
relative to my opponents? Perhaps you have just 
experienced a large drop in a heads-up match. The luckometer
can help you determine if you were simply dealt a bad
run of cards, or if you are <i>on tilt</i>.
<p>
"Luck" is defined by a simplistic, objective formula based
only on the cards dealt. The player who is dealt the winning 
hand receives the luck for that hand, and the players dealt 
losing hands receive the corresponding amount of negative 
luck for that hand.
<p>
"Luck" is proportional to the strength of the hands dealt.
For instance, flopping a nut flush is considered luckier
than flopping two-pair. However, it is considered far 
luckier to flop a nut flush, if your opponent also flops
the second nut flush. 


<h3>Luckometer plots</h3>
Using our simple metric, a plot of 'luck' can be overlayed 
with a bankroll plot. Although the luck plot is not on the
same scale as the bankroll plot, trends in luck can be
compared to trends in the bankroll. 
<p>
Luckometer results are well defined for heads-up play, and
an extremely high correlation with luck is typical between 
evenly matched players. The Luckometer ratings are more 
difficult to define for full-ring games, and so the correlation 
is less significant.
