<h1>Poker Academy Currency (PAX)</h1>

<h3>What are PAX?</h3>
Poker Academy Online is a play money site. The biggest problem with play money 
is that the games are not realistic. Players simply do not play the same way
with chips that are worthless as they do when the chips have value. PAX is our
attempt to give the chips in Poker Academy a real value. You have to work to
earn PAX, and if you lose them through careless play, you will have to work
to get more. This gives PAX real value. This helps make our PAX games play
much like real-money games, despite being a play money site. Players that
do not take the game seriously will quickly loose any PAX they have and will
be back at the bottom rung.

<h3>Play Money v.s. PAX</h3>
Poker Academy Onine has two types of games; PAX games and Play Money games.
Designating a room to be play money instead of PAX means anyone can sit down
at no cost, and can rebuy (if applicable) an unlimited number of times. Play
money games are provided for players who don't want to invest the time to 
build up a PAX bankroll. It can also be useful when you just want to goof-off
or experiment with radical styles. Play money games are considered exhibition
games, and statistics are not kept by the server.

<h3>How do I get PAX?</h3>
Everyone stats with zero, none, nil, no PAX. All PAX in the system MUST be earned. 
This is the major difference between Poker Academy Online and other online poker 
sites. Each PAX carries the value of someone's time invested to earn that chip.
<p>
PAX Freerolls are the main source for earning your initial PAX bankroll. There will 
always be a freeroll table, that anyone can join for free. The higher you place in 
the SnG the more PAX you will earn, the last places will not earn anything. Your 
freeroll earnings will only be paid up to a maxium bankroll of 50 PAX. 

<h3>What can I do with my PAX?</h3> 
Earning PAX first and foremost lets you practice proper bankroll management.
As your bankroll grows, you can play increasingly higher limits. Only the best
players will be able to rise to the highest limits, and thus you will face the
most challenging opponents available. Standings are given showing all player's
PAX won or lost at the tables. By being rated, you can quickly learn where
you stand relative to the rest of the community.
