<h2 align="center">Hand Filters</h2>

Several filters are available from the <i>Filters</i> panel. A filter will let you look at only a 
specific subset of the hands you have played. For instance, if you wanted to show only statistics
from heads-up games, select <i>Max -&gt; 2 Players</i>. You can also filter 
the statistics based on your position. For instance, to show only hands where you were in the big
blind, select <i>Position -&gt; Big Blind </i>. Filters are applied to all hands on all
tabs.

<h4>Units</h4> 
<dl>
   <dt>$/h</dt><dd> Dollars per Hand.  This unit type should be used if
   you want to see how an actual poker bankroll would have changed 
   over the selected sessions.  For ring games, if you select
   this unit type, the graph will show the selected player's winnings in 
   dollars.  For tournaments, this unit type causes the graph to map the 
   selected player's tournament chips throughout a tournament session to 
   predicted tournament winnings in dollars. This is done using a variant 
   of the <a href="glossary.html#icm">Independent Chip Model</a> (ICM).  At 
   the start of each tournament there will be a sharp drop and this corresponds
   to the rake taken to play the tournament.  Also, while a tournament is
   unfinished, it is plotted in gray and does not count toward the current
   bankroll until it is is finished.</dd>
   
   <dt>sb/h</dt><dd>Small Bets per Hand.  A small bet is equal to a big
   blind.  When this unit type is selected, all of a player's winnings in a
   hand are converted into a multiple of the size of the small bet for that
   hand and then plotted.  This type of unit is useful when you want to 
   view your win rate across sessions of games with different sized stakes.  
   It is important to be aware that for tournaments the size of the small bet 
   increases as the levels in a tournament increase.  As a result, care should
   be taken when interpreting a graph plotted using this unit type if the
   sessions selected include both ring and tournament sessions.
   </dd>
   
   <dt>T/h</dt><dd>Tournament Chips per Hand. This unit type is for when
   you want to plot the size of your stack of tournament chips thoughout 
   a tournament.  When this unit type is selected, the size of the big 
   blind is plotted alongside your tournament chip graph so you 
   can easily see the information together. Note, this option is only 
   available to be selected when your selected sessions are purely 
   tournaments and is best viewed a single tournament at a time.
