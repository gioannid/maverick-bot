<p>
The Bankroll Graph tab graphically plots a running total of 
the selected player's winnings over all selected sessions.
If only one session is selected, the resulting graph is 
straight-forward showing only the player's winnings for that
session.  If more than one session is selected, the plot
shows the player's winnings in each selected session appended
one after the other session by session from left to right.
</p>

<p>
If not too many sessions are selected and plotted together,
each session will have blue dots indicating its start and
end points.
</p>

<p><div id="sidebar">
Tip: If the selected sessions include both ring game and 
tournament sessions, they will both be plotted together, but 
you should take care when interpreting these results because 
you really are looking at two different types of games all at once.

<h3>Graph Options</h3>
<p>
The way the Bankroll Graph is plotted can be customized.  
These options allow you to customize the plot's units on both 
the vertical axis (i.e. <b>Units</b>) and the horizontal axis 
(i.e. <b>Type</b>).
</p>

<h4>Units</h4> 
<dl>
   <dt>$/h</dt><dd> Dollars per Hand.  This unit type should be used if
   you want to see how an actual poker bankroll would have changed 
   over the selected sessions.  For ring games, if you select
   this unit type, the graph will show the selected player's winnings in 
   dollars.  For tournaments, this unit type causes the graph to map the 
   selected player's tournament chips throughout a tournament session to 
   predicted tournament winnings in dollars. This is done using a variant 
   of the <a href="glossary.html#icm">Independent Chip Model</a> (ICM).  At 
   the start of each tournament there will be a sharp drop and this corresponds
   to the rake taken to play the tournament.  Also, while a tournament is
   unfinished, it is plotted in gray and does not count toward the current
   bankroll until it is is finished.</dd>
   
   <dt>sb/h</dt><dd>Small Bets per Hand.  A small bet is equal to a big
   blind.  When this unit type is selected, all of a player's winnings in a
   hand are converted into a multiple of the size of the small bet for that
   hand and then plotted.  This type of unit is useful when you want to 
   view your win rate across sessions of games with different sized stakes.  
   It is important to be aware that for tournaments the size of the small bet 
   increases as the levels in a tournament increase.  As a result, care should
   be taken when interpreting a graph plotted using this unit type if the
   sessions selected include both ring and tournament sessions.
   </dd>
   
   <dt>T/h</dt><dd>Tournament Chips per Hand. This unit type is for when
   you want to plot the size of your stack of tournament chips thoughout 
   a tournament.  When this unit type is selected, the size of the big 
   blind is plotted alongside your tournament chip graph so you 
   can easily see the information together. Note, this option is only 
   available to be selected when your selected sessions are purely 
   tournaments and is best viewed a single tournament at a time.
   </dd>   
</dl>


<h4>Type</h4>
<dl>
   <dt>Hands</dt><dd> Changes the horizontal axis of the graph to be 
   in units of hands played.
   </dd>
   
   <dt>Sessions</dt><dd> Changes the horizontal axis of the graph to 
   be in units of sessions played.   
   </dd>
</dl>


<h3>Graph Analysis</h3>
<p><b>Luckometer</b> - 
plot the 'luck' of the cards for each hand shown in the graph. For additional
details a full description of the <a href="luckometer.html">luckometer</a> is 
provided. 
</p>
<p><b>Pre-flop luck</b> -
plots a graph of how strong your starting hands have been, on
a percentage scale, where 50% would be an average starting hand.
</p>
<p><b>Played Hands %</b> -
shows how loose or tight you have been playing pre-flop. This
is also a percentage scale, so if you have been playing all hands, the graph would 
rise to the top of the scale, while folding everything would have the graph fall 
to the bottom.
