<h1 align="center">Home Tournament Clock</h1>

<p>
Nowadays, lots of people enjoy getting together with friends to play in their 
own home poker tournaments for fun.  To help you organize and efficiently 
manage these tournaments, Poker Academy provides a <i>Home Tournament Clock</i>.
</p>

<p>
Poker Academy's Home Tournament Clock makes it easy for you to keep track of all 
the essential tournament information: the blinds and levels, the prize payouts, 
the number of players entered and their buy-ins.  With all these great features, 
you can make sure your home tournaments go as smoothly as the tournaments in 
the casinos do.
</p>

<p>
The Home Tournament Clock is a separate program which you can start from 
Poker Academy's <a href=gs-mainlobby.html">Main Lobby</a> or from its Window menu.  
When the clock is first opened you will see four main areas: the blind 
structure, buy-in/add-on/rebuy data, the payout structure, and a tournament 
level timer with controls. 
</p>

<p align="center">

<h3>Tournament Blind Structure</h3>

<p>
Poker Academy's Home Tournament Clock ships with some default tournament blind
structures that you can choose between or edit.  To choose one of these structures, 
use the pull-down structure chooser at the top of the window.
</p>

<p>
When the Home Tournament Clock is run for the first time, a bare bones initial 
structure is selected by default.  Each subsequent time you open the 
Home Tournament Clock, the last structure you chose will be automatically selected 
and loaded.
</p>

<p>
Along with the structure chooser there are five toolbar buttons:

<table id="defined">
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/rg-but-create.png" width="14" height="16">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Creates a new structure that you can name and edit.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/rg-but-trash.png" width="14" height="16">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Deletes the currently selected structure.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/save.png" width="32" height="32">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Saves the currently selected structure to disk.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/plus.png" width="32" height="32">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Adds a new level to the current structure. If you have a row selected, 
		 that row will be duplicated. If no levels are selected, a level will be 
		 added to the end of the structure. 
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/minus.png" width="32" height="32">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Deletes the selected level(s) from the structure. If no row is selected, the 
		 delete button will be disabled.
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p id="sidebar">
Tip:  You can only make changes to the structure or select a new structure 
before the clock has been started or after the clock has been reset.
</p>

<p>
To edit the current tournament structure, double-click on the table cell 
you wish to update, and change the value.  You may adjust the values of antes,
small blinds, or big blinds in any of the structures you choose.
</p>  

<p>
When you make an error editing the structure, the invalid cells will be 
highlighted in <b>red</b> to alert you to the problem.  Errors can exist when you 
make an ante bigger than the small or big blind, or make the small blind bigger 
than the big blind for a single level.  Errors can also exist when the blinds 
decrease from one level to the next in the structure.  For a tournament, the 
blinds should increase from level to level or sometimes they may remain the same.
</p>

<p>
Below the blind structure table is the <b>level length control</b>.  You can change 
the number of minutes that each level will take by adjusting the spinner.  
You may also adjust the spinner while the clock is running and the setting 
will take affect on the next round.  For example, you want the first four
levels of your tournament to be 15 minutes long, and every level after
that to be 20 minutes long.  To set this up, simply set the level length 
to 15 minutes and start your tournament clock.  After level four has started 
and the clock is counting down the 15:00 minutes you can adjust the level 
length to 20 minutes and when level 5 starts the clock will begin using a 
20:00 minute timer.
</p>  

<p>
If you have <b>pause after each level</b> option selected, the clock will pause when 
a level is complete and wait for you to start the timer to begin the next level.
</p>

<h3>Buy-ins, Rebuys, and Add-Ons</h3>
<p>
On the left-side of the Home Tournament Clock under the level structure table, 
there are entry fields which you can use to keep track of information
regarding players' <b>buy-ins</b>, <b>rebuys</b>, and <b>add-ons</b>.  Entering this information
allows the tournament clock to automatically track the prize pool of the
tournament which is in turn used to automatically compute your desired 
tournament payouts.  In addition, the tournament clock will also use this
information to keep track of the total number of chips in play.
</p>

<p> 
The <b>buy-in</b> entry fields allow you to specify the number of players buying in
to play in your tournament, the price each person is paying to buy-in,
and the number of chips each player gets for a buy-in. 
</p>

<p>
The <b>rebuy</b> entry fields let you keep track of the number of players that
purchased rebuys, the cost of a rebuy, and the chips given per rebuy.
</p>

<p>
The <b>add-on</b> entry fields let you keep track of the number of players
that purchased add-ons, the cost of an add-on, and the chips given per add-on.
</p>

<p>
Values entered into these fields are automatically remembered by the 
Home Tournament Clock and will be automatically loaded on subsequent
startups (except for the number of rebuys and add-ons which are
automatically reset to zero on each startup).
</p>

<h3>Tournament Prize Payouts</h3>
<p>
The Tournament prize payouts table lets you customize the values of prizes paid
out in your home tournament.  The number of payout rows in the payout table are
automatically adjusted to equal the number of players buying into your tournament
which is set by the buy-in entry field.  This helps to make sure that you
cannot accidentally provide payouts to more people than those who entered your
tournament.
</p>

<p>
When you increase the number of player buy-ins, and the prize pool is 
fully allocated, each subsequent entry will receive a 0% payout.  
If the entire prize pool has not been fully allocated, 
each additional buy-in and subsequent payout row added will automatically be given 
a payout value.  This payout value corresponds to the prize pool amount 
left to be paid and the value of the previous payout entry.  Adding payouts automatically
in this manner ensures that the prize pool is never over-allocated, and that the
size of the payouts never increase as players finish in worse spots.
</p>

<p>
To adjust a payout value simply double-click to edit the desired table cell.  If you
adjust the '% Prize Pool' value, the gross payout will be automatically updated and 
vice versa.
</p>   

<p>
When you make an error editing the values in the payout table, the cells will be 
highlighted with different colors to denote the different errors.  <b>Green</b> highlighting 
means that the current payout table entries do not give out 100% of the prize pool.
You can find the percentage still left to allocate by mousing over the payout table
and reading the value in the tool tip.  <b>Red</b> highlighting means you have allocated 
more than 100% of the prize pool and you need to remove a certain % from the payout 
table.  Again, you can find this percentage by holding the mouse over the payout table
and reading the percentage in the tool tip that will appear.  <b>Orange</b> highlighting 
means that the highlighted payout entries are inconsistent.  That is, a higher placed 
finisher will receive less money than a lower placed finisher.
</p>

<p>
The values in the payout table are automatically updated whenever more money enters the 
prize pool through buy-ins, rebuys or add-ons.  Below the prize pool there are some basic 
summary stats about your tournament including the total prize pool, and total chips in play.
</p>

<h3>Clock Display and Control</h3>
<p>
On the right-hand side of the Home Tournament Clock is a large timer panel.  This panel
displays the current level, the time left, and the current blinds.  Below this display 
information are the clock controls:

<table id="defined">
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/clock-play.gif">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Starts the level timer.  Once the timer is started, the play button changes
		 to a pause button.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/clock-pause.gif">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Pauses the level timer.  Once the timer is paused, the pause button changes to
		 a play button.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/clock-prev-level.gif">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Takes the tournament clock back to the start of the previous blind level.  This
		 resets the level timer and pauses the timer.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/clock-next-level.gif">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Takes the tournament clock to the start of the next blind level.  This
		 resets the level timer and pauses the timer.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td align="center" valign="tops">
		<img src="images/clock-reset.gif">
	</td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">
		 Resets the Home Tournament Clock timer and levels.  Once the tournament
		 clock is started, the tournament's level structure is considered locked,
		 and you can only choose a new structure or edit the current one after
		 using this button to reset the clock.	
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
The <i>Start Break</i> button just below the clock controls starts a break timer 
for the given number of minutes specified.
To change the length of the break simply adjust the number of minutes before pressing
the <i>Start Break</i> button.  
You can start the break at any time once the clock has been started.
If you start a break during the middle of a level, the level will pause, and 
the timer will be restored once the break has been completed.  If you wish to 
stop a break before it is complete simply press the <i>Stop Break</i> button, 
which replaces the <i>Start Break</i> button when the break timer is started.
