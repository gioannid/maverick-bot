The Player Statistics panel presents detailed information on the selected
player. Every hand ever played by that player is accessible from this window.
The upper portion of the screen will list the <i>sessions</i> they have played.
The filters on the upper-left will filter the session list by game type, stakes,
and table name. Summary information of the selected sessions in the table is
displayed in the bottom portion of the window. The bottom portion has two modes,
<a href="#SESSION">Session Stats</a> and 
<a href="#HAND">Hand Stats</a>. 

<h2><a name="SESSION">Session Stats</a></h2>
<p align="center">

<p>
Session stats shows information about
the overall sessions. If a single session or tournament is selected, then results
for that single session are displayed. If multiple sessions are selected, a
bankroll graph is shown on the right, and session totals are given on the left.


<h2><a name="HAND">Hand Stats</a></h2>
<p align="center">
<img src="images/player3-small.png" width="261" height="189">
<p>

The hand stats section displays summary information at the hand level. The hand
stats displayed are based on the sessions selected in the upper table. The
<a href="stats-filters.html">Hand Filters</a> on the right let you filter the
hands to match specific criteria such as your position, number of players, or
your hole cards. Some basic totals are displayed below, and the main area
to the right contains several tabs with detailed information: 
<ul>
 <li><a href="stats-graph.html">Bankroll Graph</a>
 <li><a href="stats-actions.html">Action Summary</a>
  <li><a href="stats-frequencies.html">Frequency Summary</a>
 <li><a href="stats-preflop.html">Pre-Flop Hand Statistics</a>
 <li><a href="stats-sharksfish.html">Sharks &amp; Fish Table</a>
</ul>
 
<h3>Totals</h3>
After applying all the filter the totals are displayed.
<p align="center"><img src="images/playerstat-totals.png">
<dl>
   <dt>Hands</dt><dd> The total number of hands </dd>
   <dt>Raked</dt><dd> The total amount ranked </dd>
   <dt>Units Won</dt> <dd>The total amount of the selected units won</dd>
   <dt>Units / Hand</dt> <dd>The total amount of selected units won per hand</dd>
</dl>
