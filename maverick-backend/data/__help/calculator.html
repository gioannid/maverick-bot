The Showdown Calculator is a powerful tool for calculating the 
chances of a hand winning, tying, or losing at the showdown. 
Clicking on any of the red card-backs will bring up a card chooser.
Any cards that are left unspecified (shown as a card-back rather
than a specific card image) represent any random available card.

<p id="sidebar">
To quickly flip cards back to random cards without going to the card chooser, 
hold down the control key and click the card.
</p>
<p>
Cards can be loaded from games in progress by choosing 
<i>Load Current Hand</i> or <i>Load Hand 
and Opponent Hands</i> from the <i>Options</i> menu.
<p>
Once the scenario has been entered, there are two methods of 
performing the calculation: <b>Enumeration</b> and <b>Simulation</b>.
<p>
<h3>Enumeration</h3>
You should use Enumeration only when you have a small number of random 
cards in your scenario and you would like an exact result. Enumeration 
will calculate the winner of every possible card combination and display 
exact numbers. This is practical only with a small number of random cards, 
as the number of card combinations and thus the length of time to 
calculate grows exponentially with each one. Enumerations are 
typically used with 6 or fewer random cards.

<p id="sidebar">
Tip: If you choose Enumerate on a scenario with many random cards and 
don't feel like waiting for the heat-death of the universe you can 
always click the X button to stop the calculation.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Simulation</h3>
Simulations are a fast alternative to enumeration since they are not 
affected by the number of random cards. Using Monte Carlo sampling, 
the simulation quickly converges to a very good approximation of the 
relative values. The more trials used, the more accurate the approximation 
becomes. Simulations are typically used with 7 or more random cards.
<p>
When running a simulation, you can stop at any time. Once the numbers 
appear to have stabilized, finishing the trials will have only a minor 
effect on the accuracy.

<p id="sidebar">
Tip: You can toggle between displaying relative percentages or exact totals 
by clicking on the results under each hand.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
There are numerous questions the Showdown Calculator can be used to 
answer. For instance, you may want to know how often Ah-Kh beats Jc-Js. 
Simply set the number of hands to 2, set the two hands to the appropriate cards, 
and click <b>Enumerate</b>. Within a few seconds, it will show that the pocket 
Jacks are a 53.7% favorite to win. In this case enumeration is used since 
the 5 board cards are the only random cards. 
<p>
Now perhaps you want to know what your pre-flop chances are with pocket Jacks, 
when you are up against 5 other players. Set the number of players to 6, 
enter Jc-Js into the first hand, and leave the rest wild. In this case we 
use <b>Simulate</b> since there are 15 random cards. You will find that 
Jacks will hold up about 33% of the time.
<p>
Now compare what happens to your Jacks when you simulate an Ace-high 
flop such as Ad-2c-7h. Next, compare this to a flop such as Td-2c-7h 
where your Jacks are an over pair.
<p>
<h3>Note</h3>
When using the showdown calculator, keep in mind that wildcards are 
taken from a <i>uniform distribution</i>. That is, all possible 
combinations are equally likely. The calculator does not attempt to
model what hands your opponents are likely to be holding.  In
addition, it gives you the final winning percentage assuming all
hands have stayed to the showdown.
