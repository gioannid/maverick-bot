<h1 align="center">Jambot</h1>

Jambot uses David Sklansky's No-Limit Tournament <i>System</i> 
Strategy. It will either fold or go all-in pre-flop, based on a simple
formula. The system was designed for a casino owner's daughter,
who knew nothing about Hold'em or poker, so that she could play
in the World Series of Poker.
<p>
Only premium hands are used to either steal the blinds or have a
good chance of winning if called. As the blinds grow in proportion
to the stacks, the set of played hands grows in order to continue
stealing blinds at the rate required to stay alive in the tournament.

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

Sklansky-1 plays the strategy defined in <i>Tournament Poker 
For Advanced Players</i> by David Sklansky. System-2 uses the 
more complex system later published in <i>Card Player Magazine</i> (April 3rd, 2003).
