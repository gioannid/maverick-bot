<h1 align="center">Xenbot</h1>

Xenbot plays a solid, configurable strategy for 
No-Limit tournaments.

The basic strategy was inspired by the guidelines
set forth in Darse Billings' <i>A Primer for Playing 
No-Limit Hold'em Tournaments</i>.

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

The pre-flop hand selection is highly configurable, using the
pre-flop groups editor. XenBot has ten pre-flop hand groups, and 
each group of hands is played differently. Each starting hand
can be assigned to one of the ten groups.


<p><b>Group One</b><br>
Premium hands that will be raised or re-raised in any position.
Raise or call all-in if need be.

<p><b>Group Two</b><br>
Raise the blinds and one or two limpers,
otherwise will call if we are short stacked, or
the amount to call does not commit our stack.

<p><b>Group Three</b><br>
Raise the blinds in late position, limp in early position.
Call if short stacked, or if the amount is small.

<p><b>Group Four</b><br>
Raise the blinds only in late position, limp
only in mid to late position, and call if
short stacked.

<p><b>Group Five</b><br>
Raise if heads-up, or raise the blinds short handed.
Limp in mid to late position. Raise or call if short stacked.

<p><b>Group Six</b><br>
Raise the blinds heads-up, or short-stacked. Call 
in the small blind, or limp in late position.
Raise or call if short stacked.

<p><b>Group Six A</b><br>
Raise in late position, when short-stacked, or
when short-handed.  Call if already put money
in the pot and have decent odds.  Call
if up against an aggressive opponent short-handed.
Raise or call if short stacked.

<p><b>Group Seven</b><br>
Limp in late position, raise the blinds heads-up.
Raise or call if short stacked.

<p><b>Group Eight</b><br>
Heads-up only. Raise if short-stacked, raise the blinds,
or call small amounts if stacks are large.

<p><b>Bluffs</b><br>
Raise if heads-up, or raise the blinds, but fold if re-raised.

<p><b>No Group</b><br>
Check or fold.

<h3>Post-Flop Options</h3>
Post-flop actions are controlled by three sliders. The first sets the aggression
level of the player to be high or low. Aggression effects the player's standards
for betting or raising.

Implied odds and showdown odds can be estimated liberally or conservatively. This
will effect how often the player will call with draw odds or with weaker hands.
