<h1 align="center">Online Table Creation</h1>

After connecting to the online game selection server, you may not always
wish to simply sit down at an available table.  There may all be
tournaments that have started, be already full, or perhaps you simply
want to play a game solely with friends of yours.
<p>

Instead of joining a room directly, you have the option to create
your own room and have people join it.  Pressing "Create Room" in the lobby
brings up the create room dialog.  There are a number of options you can select.
<p>

<u>Name and Password</u> - this is the name your room will have in the
name selection screen.  You may leave it as the default name or change it
as you wish.  No two rooms may have the exact same name.  The password
is an optional field.  If you leave it blank anyone will be able to 
join, if you give it a value then only people to whom you have told the password will
be able to join your room.
<p>

<u>Game Type</u> - 
Next, choose the type of game you want to play. You can choose 
Limit or No-Limit, Ring game or Tournament, and the currency to 
use (play money, or PAX).  Depending on the choice of Ring game
or Tournament, a different settings panel will be shown with the
applicable options for that game type.
<p>

<u>Ring Game Settings</u> - this tab is the default, leave it here to create a ring
game.  You are able to specify the betting structure (limit or no limit), the
minimum and maximum number of players, the stakes, and the starting bankroll.
The minimum number of players is used to determine when to start the game--as
soon as enough people are seated it will begin.  If you set the starting bankroll
to zero, users will be able to set their bankroll as they please when they sit
down at the table.
<p>

<u>Tournament Settings</u> - choose this tab to create a tournament.  
You should begin by selecting the betting structure (limit or no limit)
as that will determine what tournament structures are available.  From
there you should select a tournament structure as that will set the other 
fields to defaults for that structure.  Finally you can optionally edit the 
other fields.  Maximum players specifies the most that can be in the tournament 
-- there is no minimum as the game owner can press the Start Tournament button 
whether she wishes to start the game.  The remaining options modify the 
tournament structure and allow you to play a faster or slower tournament 
progression as you wish.
<p>

<u>Finishing</u>
Once you have finished creating your room you will see it appear in the
room list.  Select and join your room like you would any other room.  If
it is a tournament you will see you have a "Start Tournament" button where
the "Deal" button is usually.  Only the creator of the room can start a
tournament.
