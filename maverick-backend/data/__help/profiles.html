<h1 align="center">Profiles</h1>

Each profile you create will be treated as a different and uniquely named player, with 
its own set of statistics and hand histories.  Computer opponents will learn 
and adjust their play to each profile.
<p>
The purpose of profiles is two-fold. Most importantly, each profile is tracked
separately in the Player Statistics. The computer opponents will also treat each 
profile as a brand new player.

<b>Tip:</b> Profiles are very useful for trying out different
styles of play. For instance, you might have one profile for goofing around and
experimenting with wild strategies, another profile for serious play, another
for playing with all cards face up, and one for drilling on specific game situations.
For instance, you might set up the dealer options to deal you King-Jack off suit 
(KJo) in early position every hand so that you can play it out 500 times to learn 
how to play that scenario better. By using a different profile for the drill, you
won't pollute your player statistics from other sessions.
