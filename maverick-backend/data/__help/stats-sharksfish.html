<h2>Sharks &amp; Fish</h2>
The Sharks &amp; Fish table shows how much you have won or lost directly against each 
opponent you have faced. You can quickly learn which players are taking your money,
and which ones are helping to pad your wallet.

By default, players you are winning against are shown in green, players you are
break-even with are shown in white, and players you are losing to are shown 
in red.

Tip: Double click a row to bring up a 
<a href="history.html">Hand History Browser</a> showing just the relevant hands
between you and the opponent. A hand is considered relevant if both you and 
the selected opponent put money in the pot. This will filter out all hands where
you or the opponent folded pre-flop and did not contest the pot.
