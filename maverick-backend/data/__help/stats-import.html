<p>
The Hand History Importer will import hands from the major Online Poker sites.
The importer will group your hands by the site and session they where played online, and 
produce the same extensive stats as your Poker Academy hands.  Imported hands
can also be played back in the same manner as the rest of the hands in your Hand History
Database.  
</p>

<p id="sidebar">
<b>Note:</b> Texas Hold'em Limit, Pot Limit and No Limit Ring games are currently only supported.
Files that failed to be imported are stored on your hard disk, for later import when other game
types are supported. Tournaments are not yet supported.</p>

<h3>Importing Hand Histories</h3>
Online Hand Histories must be read from a text file, typically on the computer's 
hard drive.  It is recommended that you place all of your online hand histories in a 
seperate directory and copy / backup regularly.  Poker Academy can scan a directory
and will import all hands into the database. The following Online Sites are currently supported:
</p>

<dl>
 	<dt>Party Poker</dt>
     <dd>Hand Histories can be configured to be saved on your hand drive.
         This can be configured in Party Poker client's menu using 
         Options -> Hand History Configuration Options</dd>
   <dt>Poker Stars</dt>
      <dd>Hand Histories from the past 30 days can be saved to your hand drive. Within
        the Poker Stars client's menu go to: Options -> Instant Hand History Options...</dd>
   <dt>Paradise Poker</dt> 
      <dd>Hand Histories can be requested for your most recent 100 hands played.  This
      can be done from the Paradise Poker client using either the Options menu or the 
      Dealer Chips Tray.
      </dd>
