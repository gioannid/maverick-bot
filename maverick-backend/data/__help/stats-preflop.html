<h2>Pre-Flop Stats</h2>
The pre-flop stats table breaks your hands down by pre-flop starting hand, 
and shows how much you have won or lost with each type of starting hand. 
This is very useful for learning which hands you should either fold more often, 
or learn to play differently post-flop.

By default, hands you are winning with are shown in green, hands you are
break-even with are shown in white, and hands you are losing with are shown 
in red.

Note: Don't read too much into your hand values until you have collected
enough hands to have statistical significance. You will need hundreds of
examples for each starting hand before the values are meaningful.

Tip: Double click a row to bring up a 
<a href="history.html">Hand History Browser</a> showing all of the hand 
histories where you had the selected hole cards. For instance, if you notice 
you're losing money with a particular hand type, you can instantly bring up all
of the relevant hand histories for review.
