<h1 align="center">SideBar: Hand Evaluator</h1>
The <i>Hand Evaluator</i> panel in the <i>SideBar</i> provides you with
immediate summary information about your hand as well as your immediate
pot odds.  The summary information displayed for your hand depends on 
whether the current action is in the preflop or postflop stage of the game.
For more detailed information on hand evaluation, please see the help
information on the full <a href="evaluator.html">Hand Evaluator</a>.

<h3>Preflop Hand Information</h3>
For preflop decisions, your hand is described according to its
preflop <i>hand value</i>. Your preflop hand value is determined
by seeing how highly your hand is ranked out of the 169 possible distinct 
preflop hands. This value is displayed both in terms of the percentage of hands 
your hand is ranked higher than and also as its actual ranking
out of the 169 hands where a rank of 1 is the best possible preflop hand 
ranking and a rank of 169 is the worst possible preflop hand ranking.

<p>
There are 169 preflop hands when you ignore the specific suits of your
preflop hole cards and instead just look at whether your hole cards are 
paired or unpaired and suited or unsuited.  

<p id="sidebar">
<b>Note:</b> The hand rankings are based on computer simulations. They are not
to be taken as the gospel truth, as it is impossible to rank starting 
hands perfectly, since their ranking (chance of winning) changes a great 
deal depending on the game conditions. Our computer simulation rankings 
are general, well-rounded rankings.</p>

<h3>Postflop Hand Information</h3>
For postflop decisions, your hand is described by three components.

<h4>Hand Name</h4>
The first component describing your hand is the name of the best 5-card poker
hand you currently have.  For, example, if you have JdTd as your hole
cards and the flop is 9dJhQd then your hand would be assigned the name 
"a Pair of Jacks".

<h4>Strength</h4>
In addition to your hand name, the immediate strength of your hand 
will be shown. The strength of your hand is an estimate of the 
chances that your hand is currently better than that of all your 
opponents.  This estimate takes into account the number 
of opponents you are up against.  The estimate shown also takes into
account opponent modelling information to bias the strength estimate
based on past observations of your opponents.

<h4>Potential</h4>
The final piece of information presented to describe your hand is
the estimated positive and negative potential of your hand. Your 
hand's positive potential is the percentage of situations where 
you have a hand that is currently behind but that ends up ahead
on the next stage. Your hand's negative potential is the percentage 
of situations where your hand is currently ahead but will end up 
behind on the next stage.

<h3>Pot Odds</h3>
Your current immediate pot odds are shown both in percentage form and odds form.
When your amount to call is zero, your pot odds are displayed as "n/a".
When you are out of the hand your pot odds continue to be updated
despite the fact that you are out of the hand and you do not have an actual
amount to call.
