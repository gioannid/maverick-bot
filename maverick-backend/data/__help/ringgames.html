Ring Game poker is the classic manner of playing Texas Hold'em.  In a real
life situation, opponents sit around a table with cash in front of them and
each hand is played for real money.  The object is simple: make more money
than you lose.
<p>
With <i>Poker Academy</i> you can play and practice limit and no-limit
ring games. The limit and no-limit designation refers to the type of betting 
structure in the game.  Limit, also know as fixed limit, means that each
bet or raise is a pre-determined amount and not at the discretion of the player.
In no limit, also known as open limit, players can bet or raise any amount.
All <i>Poker Academy</i> games are played with table stakes, which means you can only
bet, raise or call to a maximum of the chips you have in front of you.
<p>
One unique aspect of ring games is the presence of a rake.  Many casinos take
a small portion of each pot, called the rake, as their fee for hosting the poker
game.  With a rake you must not only be a winning player, but must win enough
to overcome the casinos portion. <i>Poker Academy</i> allows you to simulate
the rake if you wish to and lets you choose from several popular formulas for
determining the rake amount.
