<h3 align="center">Throttles</h3>
Throttles control the speed of the game. If you find the game moves too slowly or
too quickly for your taste you can adjust the throttles to your desired speed.

<p>
<b>Actions</b><br>
The action throttle controls the minimum time between player actions. For instance,
an action throttle of one second will enforce at least one second between a player 
betting and the next player acting. 
<p>

<b>Showdowns</b><br>
The showdown throttle controls how long showdowns will take. A long showdown 
gives you more time to see what the opponent had and think about how they 
played the hand.
<p>

<b>Auto-Deal</b><br>
This sets the delay between a hand ending and the start of the next hand.
It is only used when Auto-Dealing is turned on.
<p>

<b>Fast Folds</b><br>
After you fold the hand the hand is played out by the computer opponents.
With Fast Folds on, once you have folded all throttles are set to zero
for the remainder of the hand.  That way the game plays at maximum speed 
when you are no longer in the hand.
<p>

<b>Auto-Zip</b><br>
Auto-Zip has the same effect
as clicking fold and then clicking the <i>lightning</i> button
to zip to the end of the hand. Once you have folded, all of the 
remaining players will play at maximum speed, and animation will
be disabled. Some of the more advanced opponents will play at
a reduced mental capacity in order to play faster. This is the 
fastest way to move on to the next hand.
