<h1 align="center">Dealer Options</h1>
<i>Dealer Options</i> allows you to rig the deck so that
certain cards will be dealt. Choose <i>Dealer Options...</i> 
from the <i>Dealer</i> menu.  

<p>
The options you choose here will be applied to any ring games that 
you play and to the tournament games that you are watching or participating
in. These options are never applied during online games, or to any 
background tables during a multi-table tournament.

<p id="sidebar">
Small lock icons will appear on cards that are "fixed".
</p>

<h3>Fixed Hole Cards</h3>
<i>Fixed Hole Cards</i> controls how hole cards are dealt to each player. 
Every seat has two radio buttons allowing you to specify
how cards are dealt. You can specify particular cards with the left
option or a range of cards with the right option.

<p>
Click any of the card backs to bring up the <i>Card Chooser</i> and select the
specific cards you wish to have dealt out. Cards that have been chosen elsewhere 
will appear grayed-out. Cards left face down will be dealt randomly from
the remaining cards in the deck.

<p id="sidebar">
To quickly flip cards back to random cards without going to the card chooser, 
hold down the control key and click the card.
</p>

<p>
Select the right radio button if you wish to select ranges of cards
to be dealt to a seat. These ranges are based on the 169 possible starting hands
in Hold'em. For example, selecting "Top 5%" would deal only premium hands that fall 
in the top 5% of these 169 hands. Selecting "Middle 30%" would select a larger range
of middling hands from the centre of this ranking of hands.


<h3>Fixed Board Cards</h3>
<i>Fixed Board Cards</i> controls how the board cards are dealt. 
You can specifically select each board card with the card chooser as described above.

<h3>Other Options</h3>
You can uncheck <i>Log Hand Histories and Statistics</i> so that
games played will not be logged in the <i>Hand History Database</i> 
or affect the tracked statistics in the <i>Player Statistics System</i>.
You may wish to not record games and stats where you where the deal has been 
skewed. 

<p id="sidebar">
You can use different <i><a href="profiles.html">profiles</i> when playing
or practicing with a skewed deck to keep the statistica and histories separate.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Remove Cap once Heads-Up</i> option means that when you
are playing against only one opponent in a limit game, more 
than 4 bets or raises are allowed in a round. This an optional rule in 
Hold'em seen in many cardrooms.

<h3>How Can This Help Me?</h3>
Being able to control which cards are dealt to which seat is a powerful
tool for learning about different poker situations. For example, you can
force yourself to be dealt various hole card pairs that you are 
uncomfortable playing so that you can try out various strategies and 
see which ones work in which situations. When you combine this 
ability with the ability to "fix" board cards and additionally even 
your position in a ring game, you have the ability to force yourself to
learn how to deal with problematic situations until you become comfortable
with them. Additionally, these options can be used to allow you to 
practice and explore specific concepts that you may have read in poker 
books.

<p id="sidebar">
Selecting <i>Set Button</i> in the <i>Table</i> menu to set your position and 
<i>freeze Button</i> from the <i>Options</i> menu along with <i>Dealer Options</i>
allows you to set up particular scenarios that you can practice playing.
