<h1 align="center">Hands Stats - Frequencies Tab</h1>
The Frequencies panel displays a miscelaneous selection of statistics and
frequencies.


<h3>Steals and Calls</h3>
Shows pre-flop frequencies for stealing, folding the blinds to a steal, and cold calling.
<dl>
   <dt>Folded SB to Steal</dt>
   <dd>Number of times player folded their small blind to a steal
   out of the number of times someone attempted to steal</dd>
   
   <dt>Folded BB to Steal</dt>
   <dd>Number of times player folded their big blind to a steal
   out of the number of times someone attempted to steal</dd>
   
   <dt>Attempt to Steal</dt>
   <dd>Number of times player attempted to steal the blinds
    out of the number of times they had the opportunity.  A steal attempt
    is defined when a player raises in the cutoff or on the button in a six or more
    handed game when everyone has folded before them.</dd>
    
    <dt>Cold Call %</dt>
    <dd>Calling a bet and a raise before the players,
        has invested money in the pot in that round
        out of the number of times they had the opportunity</dd>
</dl>
        
<h3>Misc Stats</h3>
This is a compilation of several different useful stats.
<dl>
   <dt> Average Pot Size</dt><dd> Sum of all pots over the total number of hands in the set units.</dd>
   <dt> Units / 100 hands</dt><dd> Profit Units per 100 hands </dd>
   <dt> Pre-flop Raise</dt><dd> The number of times the player raised pre-flop over total number of hands</dd>
   <dt> Aggression</dt>  <dd> Aggression shows a player's betting tendencies. Aggression is calculated by: <br>  
     <i>(number of raises + number of bets) / number of calls</i> <br>
     The more a player bets the more aggressive they are. The more a
     player calls the more passive they are. </dd>   
</dl>
   
        
        <h3>Stage Seen %</h3>
        <p>
The Stage Seen panel displays the percent of time the player went to each stage
out of the total number of hands.
</p>
<dl>
<dt> Hands Played</dt><dd> The percent of hands played. 
 This is similar to VP$IP - Voluntarily Put Money Into the Pot percent, 
 however VI$IP does not count calling only the big blind from the 
 small blind as a played hand. </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Won at Stage %</h3>
<p>
The Won at Stage panel displays the percent of the time the player made a profit out
of the total number of times they went to that stage.
