<h1 align="center">Sidebar: Transcript</h1>

The Transcript provides a textual log of hand information.  It shows
what actions have taken place in the hand, what cards were flopped, and
records a textual description of all the winning hands.  The Transcript
is useful to refer to if the action had gone by too quickly and you'd
like to see exactly what has gone on before.
<p>

In online mode, the Transcript also shows all player chat, and is the
only place where you can see chat from observers who are not seated at
the table.
<p>

You can turn on and off certain classes of transcript messages by
right clicking anywhere in the main transcript area.  This brings
up a menu that allows you to toggle the display of: player actions,
hand events, hand summaries, and player chat.  Note that the toggles
apply to future transcript messages, and do not filter the text that
is currently displayed.

<h3>Chatting</h3>

In online mode there is a text field underneath the Transcript.  
Click there, type your message, and press Enter to send 
it to the other players.  As an alternative to clicking in the text entry 
field you can press Tab (or any other chosen key that you set using the 
<i>Options > Edit Hot Keys...</i> menu item) and then begin to type your 
message.
