<h1 align="center">Sparbot</h1>

Sparbot can only play the heads-up game. Sparbot, as the name implies,
is a great opponent to spar against. It plays a solid, defensive game of
poker. It should be difficult to read and to exploit.
<p>
Sparbot attempts to play in a <a href=glossary.html#nearoptimal">near-optimal</a>
way. It hides information by 
playing a proper balance of randomized mixed strategies for all strengths 
of hands. However, in doing so, it will not attempt to exploit your weaknesses. 
It will merely attempt to defend against all possible methods of attack.


<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

Sparbot has a slider which allows you to specify how passive or aggressive it is.
Passive play favors checking/calling and aggressive play favors betting/raising.
