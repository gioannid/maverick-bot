<h1 align="center">Sidebar: Overview</h1>

<i>Poker Academy</i> includes the sidebar as major source of dynamic 
information when playing a poker game.  At the top of the sidebar
are four buttons which take you to the <a href="gs-mainlobby.html">Main Lobby</a>, 
<a href="evaluator.html">Hand Evaluator</a>, <a href="calculator.html">Showdown
Calculator</a> and <a href="statistics.html">Player Statistics</a>.
<p>

The main function of the sidebar is to hold a number of sidebar sections.  Each
section can be closed to just its titlebar, or opened to see its contents.  The
window is not tall enough to comfortably support all sidebar sections in their
expanded state, so you will want to pick and choose the ones you find most useful.
