The table window is where you play poker against computer opponents or
other people online. The game area displays the current table. Seats and 
cards may be clicked on for context-sensitive options. When it is your
turn to act, action buttons are displayed along the bottom of the screen.
Along the right of the table is an information 
<a href="side-overview.html">Sidebar</a> providing a game transcript, advice, and
live hand statistics.

<h3>Action Buttons</h3>

At the bottom of the screen, a number of action buttons will appear
when it is your turn to make an action.
<blockquote>
<u>Deal Hand</u>
<p>
The Deal Hand button will only appear when you can start dealing
a hand and pressing it starts the hand.  When you are playing a ring 
game or a tournament game you can use the <i>Auto Deal</i> feature to 
automatically deal hands for you so that you do not have to click this 
button every hand (see <a href="options.html#autodeal">options</a>).
<p>
<u>Fold</u>
<p>
Clicking the Fold button folds your hand. This button appears when it
is your turn to make an action and goes away when it is not your turn
to act.
<p>
<u>Check or Call $x</u>
<p>
When it is your turn to act, if there is no bet to you the 'Check' 
button will appear, which allows you to check (i.e. call $0).  
If there is a bet to you the 'Call $x' button will appear, where 
$x is the amount of the bet to you.  Pressing it will call the current bet.
<p>
<u>Bet $x or Raise $x</u>
<p>
When it is your turn to act, if there is no bet to you the 'Bet $x' 
button will appear, which allows you to bet $x dollars.  If there is a bet 
to you, and the maximum number of raises has not been met, the 'Raise $x' 
button will appear.  Pressing it will raise the current bet by $x dollars.
<p>If the game is <i>no-limit</i> then a 
slider will also appear next to the Bet or Raise button, allowing any
legal raise amount to be made. A <i>Pot</i> button will automatically bet the
size of the pot for you, and an <i>All-In</i> button will automatically raise you
all-in. If you wish to set a specific amount using the keyboard, click the <i>$</i> 
button to the right of the slider.</p><br>
<div id="sidebar">Tip: The No-Limit betting slider can be moved using your
mouse-wheel, if you have one.</div>
</blockquote>

<h3>Table Area</h3>

Each player's name is presented on their seat, along with
their current bankroll, and last action.  The player who's turn it is
to act will have a hilited rectangle.
<p>
If you click on a player's seat, you can set the bankroll for
that player and, if it is a computer player, modify the settings of that
player's poker engine.<br>

You can click on a player's cards to reveal what they 
are holding if you have "peeking" enabled (see <a href="options.html#peeking">options</a>).
