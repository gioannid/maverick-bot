<h1 align="center">Sidebar: Session Stats</h1>

The Session Stats panel records some basic statistics about your current session. And
allows you easy access to session graphs.

<h3>Statistics in Session Stats Panel</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Hands Played:</b> number of hands in this session.<p>
<li><b>Hands Won:</b> the percentage of hands played that you have won.  Tied 
hands gets counted as less than a full win depending on the %age of the pot you won.
So a three way tie would count as 1/3rd of a win.<p>
<li><b>Win Rate:</b> the number of small bets won per hand for this session.<p>
<li><b>Flops Seen:</b> the number of flops seen in this session.
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Session Information</h3>

There are two buttons at the bottom of the Session Stats panel which provide
easy access to some session information.
<p>
The <b>History</b> button brings up a <a href="history.html">Hand History Browser</a> for every hand
in that session.  This is useful to review previous hands, and for online
play it allows you to see mucked cards of your opponents.  Mucked cards are
those cards they see a showdown with but discard because they cannot beat
what you have already shown.
<p>
The <b>Chart</b> button brings up a <a href="statistics.html">Player Statistics</a>
window.  Your profile is selected, and the current session is selected.  This
lets you easily see in depth information about the current session.
