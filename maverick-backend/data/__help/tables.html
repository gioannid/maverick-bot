<h1 align="center">Ring Game Tables</h1>

Poker Academy lets you create and edit ring game <i>Tables</i>, 
which specify the opponents and seating order for a game. It comes
pre-configured with several starting tables for both limit and no limit.
<p>

Table creation and management is done from the Ring Game lobby, 
which is reached by clicking on the "Ring Games" 
button in the main lobby.


<h3>Adding and Removing Tables</h3>

list of tables.  The create table button <img src="images/rg-but-create.png"> 
creates a new Untitled table which you can edit by selecting it 
and editing it like any other table (see below).    
<br><br>

<div id="sidebar">
<b>Note:</b> The new table is either limit or no limit depending 
on the game type that is currently selected when you press the
create table button.

New in Poker Academy 2.0 is the ability to export and import tables.
If you have a table setup that you feel is unique and challenging,
you can use the export button <img src="images/rg-but-export.png"> 
to send the table to a file.  
<p>

You can then use the import button <img src="images/rg-but-import.png">
to add a table to your game.  
You can also use this feature to back up and restore table 
configurations if you need to move to another computer.  
</td></tr></table>
<h3>Table Editing</h3>

For both new tables and pre-configured tables you can edit the
computer opponents seated at that table.  The names show up in an 
entry field above the opponent list and can be edited directly.
<p>
To edit the opponents, click on a row in the opponent table.  A 
pop-up menu will appear letting you assign the seat to be empty,
filled with a random bot, or filled with a specific bot.
<p>
To edit the description click in the box below the opponent list and
enter your text.
<p>
Table changes are saved automatically.
