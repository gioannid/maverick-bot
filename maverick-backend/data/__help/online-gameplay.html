<h1 align="center">Online Game Play</h1>

In many respects playing online is very similar to playing a ring game
or a tournament against computer opponents.  However there are a number of
differences.

<h3>Game Starting</h3>

After joining a room you see the familiar poker table interface.  
The first step is to click on one of the empty seats
that says "Select Seat" on it.  If none of the seats have that on
them then the room is full, or it is a tournament room where
the tournament has already started.


<h3>Chatting</h3>

Talking to your human opponents is a big part of the enjoyment of
online games.  <i>Poker Academy</i> lets you chat to people and
have it appear in the transcript and, if you are seated, on the
screen above your cards.
<p>

In online mode there is a text field underneath the transcript in
the sidebar.  Click there, type your message, and press Enter to send 
it to the other players.  As an alternative to clicking in the text entry 
field you can press Tab (or any other key that you set using the 
<i>Options > Edit Hot Keys...</i> menu item) and then begin to type your message.

<h3>Extra Action Buttons</h3>

You will notice that there are sometimes extra action buttons beyond
the Fold, Call, Raise buttons which are available against the computer opponents.

<dl>
<dt>Fold and Show</dt>
<dd>Flashes your cards to the table before folding. This option only appears 
when your fold will end the hand.</dd>
<dt>Reveal Both</dt> <dd>Reveals both your cards to the table. This appears
after you win uncontested.</dd>
<dt>Reveal Xx</dt> <dd>Reveals either your left or right hole card only. 
This appears after you win uncontested.</dd>
