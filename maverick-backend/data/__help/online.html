<h1 align="center">Poker Academy Online</h1>

Poker Academy Online is a completely different way of playing poker
using <i>Poker Academy</i>.  Instead of playing against computer opponents,
you play against other people who also have <i>Poker Academy</i>.  These
games take place on the Poker Academy Online server and require
Internet access to play.  All games on Poker Academy Online are for
play money and there is no fee to use this service.

<p id="sidebar">
<b>Note:</b> this service allows users of Poker Academy to play against
one another online using the Poker Academy server.  It does not allow you
to connect to other online servers, and does not allow you to set a
computer opponent to play in your stead online.

There are many unique aspects to online play including: online usernames,
table selections and creation, chatting and flashing cards.  <i>Poker Academy</i>
continues to collect statistics for you just as it does for games against
computer opponents, so the same powerful tools to analyze your progress are
available.
